    "description": "BannariMaari Amman temple is located near\\nSathyamangalam, a small town named Bannari in Erode. The Gundamfestival, is\\nfamous for its theemidhi (firewalking ceremony). It is one of the few shrines\\nin Tamil Nadu where the devotees descend on the Gundam. Albeit the festival\\nhappening in Erode, this auspicious ceremony and festivities are also attended\\nby people from Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, and Kerala.\\n\\nBannari Amman’s Gundam festival is\\ncelebrated with high spirits, by people of all ages. Now, let us delve in-depth\\ninto what the Gundam festival is. The fire is kindled in the Gundam and the\\ndevotees perform the theemidhi (fire walk) ceremony. Agni Gundam or the fire\\npit practices are considered to be effective by most of the devotees because\\nthey are done as a penance to calm the apoplectic goddesses, who are often the\\navatars of Kaali, Durga and Amman. The Gundams are also done for the gods –\\nKaruppanna Swami, Iyanaar Swami, Muneeswaran Swami, Poi Solla Mei Aiyanaar, and\\na lot more of the Guardian deities we worship.\\n\\nThe Gundam festival is held annually\\nduring the month of Panguni (March – April). The BannariMaari Amman Gundam\\nfestival starts with the early morning Ganapthihomam done by the chief priest.\\nThe homam is always performed between 3:00 and 5:30 in the morning. As the\\nrituals are carried out in the dense forest near Sathyamangalam, it is easier\\nfor the devotees to collect the wooden logs needed for the ceremony. The\\nworshippers receive the holy water (theertham) after the Ganapathihomam.\\n\\nPeople who worship the Bannari Amman,\\nfirmly believe that their prayers will come true once the fire is lit in the\\nGundam. The Gundam festival revolves around the five elements of nature –\\nEarth, Water, Wind, Fire and Sky. Every single element is honoured by being\\nused in the puja for Amman at specified times of the day. Turmeric water is\\nconsidered as the water element, while incense flowers are seen as wind element\\nand temple bells as the air element. The fire element is the main of the five\\nbecause the main ritual involves fire walking. Once the deity is calmed, and\\nbathed in sandal water, the sky element comes in.\\n\\nDue to the Pandemic since 2019 December,\\nthe Gundam Festival was put on a halt for two years. In 2022, with the witty\\nplanning of the Government of Tamil Nadu, the execution of this festival was\\nsuccessful. The Gundam festival was conducted on 22nd March 2022,\\nwhich was also declared as a local holiday by the authorities.\\n\\nTens and thousands of devotees perform\\nthe fire walk ritual as a part of the festival. Specials buses from Coimbatore\\nand Mysuru were authorized and operated by Tamil Nadu State Transport\\nCorporation Limited.",

    "description": "Apart from a deep zest for life, the other important aspect of Mizo traditions is agriculture. A lot of the general populace is involved in slash-and-burn or \"jhum\" cultivation. These agriculture cycles and seasons deeply define the yearly calendars of the Mizos and inspire their festivals and celebrations. Although, after Christianity was adopted widely in the State, the drinking of rice beer at these festivals was discontinued. However, recently, efforts have been made to revive these older traditions and festivals, specially the annual Chapchar Kut.\\n\\nCultivation cycles are at the centre of this festival. Shifting or \"jhum\" cultivation is practiced here in which clearings are made in forest land and the felled trees and shrubs are left to dry under the Sun for burning purposes. \"Chapchar\" refers to this period in the cultivation cycle. This gives the farmers some rest and respite and they use this time to celebrate the Chapchar Kut festival. It is also a time when the warm weather slowly makes its presence felt, replenishing nature and providing fresh breeze. Age no bar, and dressed in colourful finery, the Mizos celebrate with much abandon.",

    "description": "Poochorithal Vizha - Arul Migu Mariamman Temple Samayapuram, Tiruchirapalli\\n\\nPoochorithal festival is the most anticipated festival, conducted in the Arulmigu Mariamman Temple at Samayapuram, Tiruchi. The ceremony marks the showering of flowers on Samayapurathu Mariamman.\\n\\nPoochorithal festival is a 28-day long festival celebrated annually over the centuries, starting from the last Sunday of the Tamil Month, Maasi ( March in Gregorian Calendar), and going up to the last Sunday of 'Panguni.'\\n\\nThis year, Poochorithal will fall from 13th March to 10th April 2022\\n\\nArulmigu Mariamman Temple, Samayapuram, is an ancient Hindu temple situated in Tiruchirappalli, Tamil Nadu, India, and is considered one of the wealthiest Temple in the state after Palani.\\n\\nYou must know that Mariamman, the primary deity, is a form of the supreme mother goddess Durga (also known as Mahakali or Aadi Shakthi) made of sand and clay like many of the traditional Mariamman deities respected as the most powerful Goddesses. As a result, unlike many other Hindu Gods, no abhishekams are performed to the main deity. Instead, the \"abhishekam\" is performed on the small stone statue in front of it.\\n\\nDevotees believe that the Goddess is endowed with immense powers to cure diseases. Hence, there is a ritual they follow in which silver or steel miniature replicas of various body parts that need to be repaired are bought and then deposited in the temple's donation box.\\n\\nAs part of the festival, it is believed that the temple's main deity herself will be fasting ('pachai pattini viratham') for all 28 days. So, only fluids like buttermilk, sugarcane juice, 'Thullu Maavu,' and coconut water, 'Paanagam', are used for abhishekam. In addition to this, devotees also offer mavilakku (a sweet dish made of jaggery, rice flour, and ghee). Devotees coming from rural areas also present some raw salt to the Goddess.\\n\\nAlso, every Sunday, devotees would offer tons of beautiful fresh flowers to the deity and take darshan. According to the rules, the temple management offers the first batch of flowers for the deity on Sunday morning and then opens the gates for others. After circumnavigating the shrine, the flowers were carried from Kodimaram to the sanctum sanctorum. These flowers are then collected and sent to the temple's micro compost yard for bio-fertiliser production.\\n\\nArulmigu Mariamman temple attracts most of the devotees/visitors on Sundays, Tuesdays, and Fridays, the holy days for Mariamman.\\n\\nSo, if you are planning your visit to Tamil Nadu during this period, you must keep one Sunday free in your itinerary and experience this holy festival “Poochorithal Vizha.”",

    "description": "Theppa Thiruvizha - Arulmigu Thayumanaswamy Temple, Rockfort, Thiruchirapalli\\n\\nTheppa Thiruvizha ofArulmigu Thayumanaswamy Temple is also known as the famous Float festival of Tiruchirappalli, India. The Thayumanaswamy Temple is situated in the Rockfort complex of Trichi and was built in the 6th century AD by the Pallava King Mahendravarman I. One has to climb up to 300 steps to reach the temple.\\n\\nTheppa Thiruvizha has been celebrated since 1546 in between the month of March-April. It is an annual festival celebrated for whole 10 days. All days have their own significance, but the final day is considered the most important day of the festival. On the last day of the float festival, the auspicious \"Teerthavari\" is conducted.\\n\\nLord Shiva is worshipped as Thayumanavar and is represented by the lingam, and his consort Parvati is depicted as Mattuvr Kuzhalammai. The presiding deity is celebrated in the 7th century Tamil Saiva canonical work, the Tevaram, written by Tamil saint muses known as the nayanars and classified as Paadal Petra Sthalam.\\n\\nAs per the historical records, a woman named Rathnavathi, a sincere devotee of Lord Shiva, was pregnant. She requested her mother to come over when she started experiencing labor pains, but her mother could not make it due to heavy floods in river Cauvery. Rathnavathi kept on praying to Shiva, even when her delivery date was near. Shiva, moved by her devotion, took the form of Rathnavathi's mother and helped her in her delivery. After her delivery, Shiva vanished, and Rathnavathi's birth mother arrived. The family discovered that it was Shiva who attended to the delivery. Therefore, Shiva in the temple is called Thayumanaswamy, meaning the Lord “who acts like a mother”. The temple was named after its presiding deity, Thayumanaswamy. Thayumanavar means the one “who became a mother”, is the name Shiva gave to a pregnant lady while he disguised himself as the mother.\\n\\nA traditional style iconic float is specially built for this annual festival, which is supposed to take the idols of deities navigating the tank. Then the Gods Thayumanaswamy and Mattuvar Kuzhalammai from the temple, along with the temple priests, sail five times on that decorated and illuminated float around the beautifully lit up central mandapam located in the middle of the temple pond (Teppakulam) which marks the end of the festival. Devotees will go home and further celebrate it in their home by feasting on delicious special meals.\\n\\nUsually, the float festival (Theppa Thiruvizha) in the Teppakulam tank is celebrated only after the corporation fills the tank with Cauvery water sourced from Kambarasanpettai collectors. However, if the rainwater is enough to host the festival, the temple employees decide accordingly without relying on the Cauvery water.",

    "description": "The Bishnupur Gharana of Hindustani Classical Music, the only specialist method of Indian Classical Music of Bengal, originated in the 13th Century following the Dhrupad tradition. Once the domain of the Malla Kings who owed allegiance to the Mughal Empire, Bishnupur has historically been the cultural capital of Eastern India. Bishnupur Music Festival, an unique initiative of West Bengal Tourism Department, pays homage to the pioneers of the tradition and keeps the rich cultural tradition alive.\\n\\nThe Bishnupur gharana remains the only vocal gharana of West Bengal, and owes much of its popularity to Bahadur Khan. A descendant of Tansen and a dhrupad vocalist of the Senia gharana, Khan fled Aurangzeb's court, like many other musicians, and settled in Bishnupur, already known for its patronage of the arts. An accomplished vocalist and instrumentalist, Bahadur Khan became the court musician of king Raghunath Singh Deo II, and soon acquired a number of disciples.\\n\\nToday, the Bishnupur Music Festival, a unique initiative of the West Bengal Tourism Department, pays homage to those long-ago pioneers, and keeps the rich cultural heritage of the land of the Malla kings alive. At par with the Khajuraho or Konark Dance Festivals in terms of popularity and reach, the festival has inevitably had to be scaled down this year owing to the Covid pandemic, but it will nevertheless go ahead, and as always, draw some of the finest names in contemporary Hindustani classical music.\\n\\nScheduled to be held between March 25 and 27, 2022, the festival will see the participation of renowned vocalists and instrumentalists alongside several other performers.",

    "description": "As the chill of winter recedes and the charm of spring descends on the Khasi Hills, it is marked by one of the community’s biggest festivals. Shad Suk Mysiem is the khasi way of offering their thanks to the creators for all the blessings and bountiful harvests received – characterized by many symbolic rituals, dances and the best of traditional apparel...\\n\\n\\n\\nShad Suk Mynseim (“the dance of peaceful hearts”) is held during the month of April. Spring is symbolic as a season of rebirth, as in the case of many societies. It signifies the beginning of the new cycle during which new seeding are planted. Shad Suk Mynseim is an agrarian festival and celebrates the optimism of the coming year.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe biggest value highlights of Shad Suk Mynseim is the dance and accompanying music. The layout of the dancers can teach observant viewers a few things about the distinctive matrilineal societies that celebrate the occasion. The dance of the maiden reflects their role in the community. They are in the middle – the keepers of the heart, home, and the lineage of the clan. The turbaned men in ceremonial apparels are the protectors, they surround the female dancers armed with waitlam (swords) and symphiah (whisk). The arrows in the quiver represents the quality of a man. The role of the man in Hynniewtrep society is to be the advisor, leader and protector – represented in the nuances of the Shad Suk Mynseim rituals.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe female dancers are clad in the best skills, and adorned with gold, coral, and silver accessories. The crown represents dignity and modesty. Chastity of the dancer is represented by the lasubon flower, an important totem for the Hynniewtrep clans.\\n\\n\\n\\nVisitors of the Shad Suk Mynsiem festival can also learn about Niam Khasi and the role of the seng Khasi – an organisation that keeping alive the old traditions and helping the indigenous beliefs and custom flourish into modern times. As the Khasis negotiate many cultural crossroads – this is one of the best ways to see the beautiful and ancient heritage, beliefs, and motifs of the community on one single stage.",

    "description": "Ganesh Chaturthi is one of the biggest festivals of Goa, and it is celebrated lavishly. Families travel across the country and sometimes the globe to be together at this time of year. The preparations for this festival begin months in advance. The festival begins at home with the purchase and ceremonial installation of a clay murti (statue). Families decorate a room by putting a matoli (a wooden canopy) adorned with flowers, seasonal vegetables and fruits before God is brought home and placed on an altar. The room is brightly lit with fairy lights adding to the cheerful hues of the decorations. Domestic celebrations end with the immersion of the idol after 1½, 5, 7, 9 or 11 days. The ladies of the house prepare Modaks( a sweet dumpling) which is a favourite of Lord Ganesh apart from Nevri, Besan Laddu and other savoury dishes which are served on banana leaves. On all days Pooja is performed and artis(devotional hymns) are sung accompanied by instruments like Ghumot and Taal. There are many rituals conducted during the festival and on the last day the idol is immersed in a water body (river, sea, lake, well, or pond). Various competitions are held during the celebrations like rangoli competition, and fancy dress competitions. The main highlight is sound and light show depicting the Gods of Hinduism.",

    "description": "4 years ago Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises development forum (MSME-DF) took up the challenge to swing this trend. Mr Rajnish Goenka, Chairman, MSME-DF identified the hurdles in the MSME sector. It was clear that this sector was being discriminated and was also being ignored. \\n\\n\\n\\n                            After a careful & planned study he created a non-political & no profitable platform for the development of MSMEs called MSME-Development Forum. \\nAfter Modi came into power things became to change swiftly. Special focus was being given to this sector, Startups were encouraged and hence economy was getting benefitted. \\nIn spite of the snags that the MSME sector faces, it still contributes 29% in the Country's GDP. The sector also provides 32% employment in manufacturing and 35% employment opportunities in Trade for the nation.\\nThe Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) sector has emerged as a highly vibrant and dynamic sector of the Indian economy over the last five decades. It contributes significantly in the economic and social development of the country by fostering entrepreneurship and generating largest employment opportunities at comparatively lower capital cost, next only to agriculture. MSMEs are complementary to large industries as ancillary units and this sector contributes significantly in the inclusive industrial development of the country. The MSMEs are widening their domain across sectors of the economy, producing diverse range of products and services to meet demands of domestic as well as global markets.\\nIn this country of 40 lacs are generated whereas the demand of these jobs are three fold than this. The only solution to this is self-employment and Entrepreneurship. MSME-DF is working on these issues of transforming job seekers to job creators. The Forum's effort is to make new India –an entrepreneurial country, making it worlds manufacturing & sourcing hub, creating Agripreneurs for rural transformation & thus controlling the migration from villages to cities. \\nIn the 21st century, history seems to repeat itself. India, like the Phoenix, is rising once again. India, the elephant, grew slowly and could not keep pace with the prowling tigers. Then came a big change; one fine day, the world woke up to see that the elephant was not just large and grey, but had developed the tiger's stripes.",

Historically, the fair is believed to have started around 200-250 years ago and is held every year on the grounds of the Trinetshwar Mahadev, which means the three eyed god. The fair celebrates ethnic folk dance, music and arts of the state and is centred around young tribal men and women seeking prospective marriage partners. One of the most popular dance forms performed is 'raas', where as many as 200 women perform the same motions in a circle. The rabari women of Zalawad perform a famous dance called rahado. Apart from the dance, one can find various bhajan mandlis (religious music groups) engrossed in singing. There are a number of stalls put up during the fair from where visitors can buy ethnic jewellery, costumes etc.",

    "description": "Mahasu Devta Temple is one of the ancient temples enlisted in the Archaeological Survey of India. It was built in the 9th century and is situated on the eastern bank of Tons or Tamas River at Hanol village, 190 km from Dehradun. A popular legend is heard regarding the existence of the main deity, Mahasu Devta. According to the legend, four divine brothers (Pavasik Mahasu, Botha Mahasu, Vasik Mahasu and Chalda Mahasu) appeared to save the land from the hands of the fierce demons. These quadruple brothers collectively came to be known as the Mahasu Devta. There are many other local legends surrounding the temple. The Mahasu Devta temple is also known for its unique style of architecture, ‘Kath – Koni’ or ‘Kothi Banal’. It is a perfect blend of stone and wooden structures.The Jagara of Mahasu Devta is the most popular ritual celebrated in the month of ‘Bhadon’. It was the time when the deity arrived to save the villagers from the demons. The Shaant festival at Hanol is also celebrated surrounding the Mahasu Devta Temple. The Mahasu Devta fair is the most prominent religious fair for the local tribes known as Jaunsari. People from other communities also join them thereby creating cultural harmony among the various communities of the nearby villages. An unusual aspect of the temple is two spherical rocks which are believed to be lifted by only a pious-hearted person. Another unique aspect is the trophies hanging on the Mahasu Devta temple walls. It is said that these trophies are awarded to the champion who wins the match between gods.",

    "description": "Ganesh Chaturthi, also known as Vinayaka Chaturthi or Vinayaka Chavithi is a Hindu festival celebrating the birth of Lord Ganesha. It is a 10-day celebration denoting the arrival of Ganesha on earth, the lord of success and knowledge.\\n\\nIt starts on the fourth day (Chaturthi) of the Hindu month of Bhadrapada (August–September). On the first day of this celebration, specially crafted idols of Lord Ganesha are installed in homes by devotees and on the last day of the celebration, the idols are immersed in a water body. During the 10-day celebration period people enjoy eating modaks and sing hymn (aartis ) dedicated to Lord Ganesha. The festival ends on the tenth day, when the idol is carried in a public procession with music and dance with herds of group chanting “Ganpati Bappa Morya“, then immersed in a nearby body of water such as a river or sea. The immersion of the idol is called Ganesh Visarjan.\\n\\nIn Mumbai alone, around 150,000 statues are immersed annually. Thereafter the clay idol dissolves and Ganesh is believed to return to Mount Kailash to Parvati and Shiva. The festival celebrates Lord Ganesh as the God of New Beginnings and the Remover of Obstacles as well as the god of wisdom and intelligence and is observed throughout India, especially in the states like Maharashtra, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Goa and Andhra Pradesh.\\n\\nThe celebration of this festival began 125 years ago in Pune and is still celebrated in the state of Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Andhra Pradesh with fervor. In Mumbai’s Siddhivinayak Temple, Prabhadevi, thousands of devotees from all around the world attend prayer meetings. To honor Lord Ganesha, devotees offer milk, jaggery, coconuts, money, flowers, and sweets to him.\\n\\nThis festival or offering prayers to Lord Ganesha is said to expel the impediment and make good circumstances for progress. It brings knowledge, riches, and satisfaction of want.",

    "description": "India is a land of diverse cultures with people from different religions and faiths living together. Hinduism is the largest of all, people worship different gods and goddesses. Of all, the one god who is worshipped before anyone else is Lord Ganesh. Also known as Vignahartha (destroyer of all obstacles) Ganesh is worshipped before starting something new and is a symbol of peace and prosperity. Hence, his birthday is celebrated with great fanfare.\\nGanesh Chaturthi is one of the biggest festivals in India. A day fanfare where the beloved god is worshipped and his birthday is celebrated by one and all. People from diverse religious and cultural backgrounds unite as one and participate in the festivities. Celebrated in Bhadra month as per the Hindu calendar, the onset of the festival can be witnessed across different parts of Telangana.\\nThe 11-day long festivities start with the idol of Lord Ganesh placed at pandals or at homes. The customs followed in Hyderabadi households begin with waking up early every morning during the festivities. After this, the family creates a Paalavalli, a bamboo roof that is tied on top of the idol with the help of strings. Fresh fruits, flowers, and books are kept near the idol of Ganesha. Stories of the Lord’s generosity and kindness are read by the elders of the family and mantras are chanted with akshatalu (a mixture of turmeric and raw rice) is sprinkled on the deity. Every year the pandals adopt a theme and the idol compliments it. From riding a motorbike to saving the planet, don’t be surprised if you see Lord Ganesh in a different avatar. People go pandal-hopping to view the glorious decorations and worship the god. On the final day of the festivities, these idols are immersed in large water bodies only to be welcomed next year.\\nThe capital city of Hyderabad comes alive during the festivities making it one of the best times to visit for travellers from across the world. Streets are decked up, pandals are set up across the city. Bazaars are bustling with people purchasing offerings for their beloved god - from idols to flowers and sweets. The sight of the tallest Ganesh statue at Khairatabad is not to be missed. With over 75,000 pandals across the city, this one stands tall and is visited by one and all.",

The first fair was hosted 200 years ago, and since then it has remained a yearly tradition, taking place in September or October, or on the fourteenth and fifteenth days of Ashwija month. Over the years, the number of worshippers has increased massively.\\n\\nDuring the celebration, the Lord’s tableau, dressed with cloth, banana leaves, and flowers, is paraded around the village streets. This march is accompanied by a group of 60 drummers drawn from around the state. The fair is associated with several rites. Some devotees believe that carrying milk as a tribute to the deity causes it to spontaneously change into curd. Another feature of the fair is a person from Chunchanoor village collecting grains from a bag stored in the temple throughout the fair. It is thought that sowing these grains into farmland would result in a high harvest that year.",

During these days people, irrespective of caste, creed participate in it in large numbers. “Mela Patt” having medieval origin occupies position among the fairs of Doda District. This is the daytime fair celebrated at “Khakhal”, a centrally located place in the township of Bhaderwah. The celebration is unique and historically traditional festival starts on the fifth day immediately after “Kailash Yatra” that is on the day of “Vinayak Chuturthi” or “Patharchoth”.\\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\\n                            Initiation of Mela Patt dates back to the sixteenth century when Akbar the great, was much impressed by the miraculous spiritual power of Raja Nagpal, the ruler of Bhaderwah Principality, at the Mughal Court, attributed to the blessings of the serpent God Nag Raj Vasuki. On the evening of “Patharchoth” or “Vinayak Choth” the “Jahari” (the conical metallic pot) is carried by a representative belonging to Raj-purohit family in Bhaderwah. The calmness of the dark starry night is broken with slogans, “Jai Bolo Nagae Basik Ki Jai, Phir Bolo Sanchae Durbar ki Jai,” The procession passes through the Main Bazars of the town. It concludes at the Vasuki Dhera Temple. Next morning after routine worship in the Temple, the Jahari moves to the house of Rajgurus' in Mohalla Khakhal. The team of selected person of the locality called “Dashan” prepare the traditional “Patt Jhanki.” The patt, a heavy load of conical shape with Jahari on the top decently decorated with marigold flowers garlands and ‘Haraii' adorned with hundreds of cloth – pieces of gorgeous colours is now ready for exhibition.\\nWith the break of dawn on Nag Panchami i.e. Rishi Panchmi a devoted person carries this “Patt” on his head in a procession led by the ‘Chela' (Mystic Man) of the deity and the musicians proceed to “Ganesh Math” for paying homage to God. “Ganpati” then the procession reaches the compound of the Vasuk Dhera Temple. The Traditional dance is performed before the Naga Deity and this procession later, concludes at the house of Rajgurus in Khakhal.

    "description": "Guru Nanak Dev Ji's wife, Sulakhni was the daughter of Mool Chand, who hailed from the Batala area of Gurdaspur district of Punjab. Usually, special rituals are performed at the Gurudwara Kandh Sahib, but this year, owing to the coronavirus pandemic, the celebrations have been cancelled. Read on to know more about the marriage anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev Ji and Sulakhni Mata. Popularly referred to as 'Babe Da Viah', the tradition of celebrating the wedding anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev Ji began in 1917 after a priest named Kesra Singh organised the 'Akhand Path' at the Gurdwara Kandh Sahib. In this place, the Guru discussed his marriage centuries ago. The wedding ceremony took place in 1487.The father of the bride wanted to have an elaborate wedding ceremony, but Guru Nanak Dev Ji opted for a simple ritual.  While discussing the marriage, Guru Nanak Dev Ji was sitting near a mud wall that was severely damaged due to heavy rains. An old woman cautioned Guru Nanak Dev Ji about the wall and asked him to move away from it, but he said that the wall would remain as it is and wouldn't fall. Interestingly, the wall still remains intact, and it happens to be a part of the Gurudwara Kandh Sahib. A few meters away from this Gurudwara is the Gurudwara Dera Sahib or the house of Mata Sulakhni Ji. This place is also called the Viah Asthan Sri Guru Nanak Dev Ji.\\nGuru Nanak Dev Ji married Sulakhni by taking four rounds around the sacred fire instead of seven.",

    "description": "The festival of Onam is celebrated throughout the state of Kerala. Kerala during Onam is marked by happiness, excitement and enjoyment among all sections of people. Onam is celebrated as an outcome of reasons that have to do with mythology as well as old agrarian practices. If one is to go by the myth, then King Mahabali or Maveli was a generous and virtuous ruler, who had once ruled Kerala. During his rule, the kingdom became so prosperous that devas (gods of the Heaven) felt jealous about this and also for the reason that King Mahabali was an asura - a member of the demon clan - who were the enemies of devas. So, they sent Lord Vishnu in the guise of Vamana (a dwarf) to King Mahabali. As an offering from the generous king, Vamanarequested Mahabali for three feet of land. And at the time of measuring the three feet of land,Vamana grew so huge that he measured all the worlds in two steps. Since he had nowhere else to place his third step, Mahabali asked Vamana to place it on his head. Pleased by his benevolence, Vamana blessed Mahabali before he was sent to the nether world and granted him permission to visit his dear subjects once in a year. This occasion is celebrated by all Keralites as Onam.\\n\\nAnd the other cause for celebrating Onam is because it is the time of the year when a good harvest has been gathered all over Kerala, resulting in plenitude and happiness.\\n\\nThe celebrations for Onam are held for ten days, beginning with the atham asterism in the month of Chingam (August / September) as per the local calendar.",

    "description": "Pang Lhabshol, a festival commemorating the consecration of Mt.Khangchendzonga as the guardian deity of the state, is unique to Sikkim. It has its origin in the Lepcha people’s belief that the mountain is their place of origin and has its roots in Lhatsun Chenpo’s ( propagator of Buddhism in Sikkim) vision. It is said that while meditating in a cave at Dzongri in West Sikkim, the mountain god Khangchendzonga appeared to him. The monk declared the mountain the guardian deity of the State. Subsequently, Chador Namgyal, the third Chogyal of Sikkim, introduced the “Pangtoed” dance and dedicated it to Kanchenjunga as a war deity. However, the actual origin of the festival is said to be the blood-brotherhood pact between the Lepcha Bonthing, ThekungTek, and Khye-Bumsa, the ancestor of the Namgyal royal family.\\n\\nPang Lhabsol combines masked dance with warrior dance. There are resplendent costumes and colorful masks, and the choreography is spectacular. Khangchendzonga itself is represented by a dancer wearing a red mask mounted with five human skulls, on top of which are mounted flags.Yabdu, Khangchendzonga’s Supreme Commander, wears a black mask, while the warriors who accompany them are attired in the traditional Sikkimese battle dress, complete with helmets, swords & shields. The dramatic entry of Mahakala, the protector of the dharma, or faith, is one of the highlights of the dance. It is Mahakala who commands Khangchendzonga and Yabdu to defend the faith and bring peace and prosperity to Sikkim. While this mystical festival is celebrated across Sikkim at different locations and monasteries, an extravagant carnival is staged on the grounds of the Tsuklakhang Monastery in Gangtok. Both tourists and locals including Bhutias, Lepchas & Nepalis take part in the festivities with great enthusiasm showcasing the vibes of communal harmony in the state.",

Legend says that a devout Brahmin promised to provide all the requirements for the Thiruvona Sadya (feast held on the Thiruvonam asterism). These were to be delivered to Aranmula Sree Parthasarathy Temple in a boat called the Thiruvona Thoni. The boat was attacked by enemy factions during its voyage. However, snake boats from the surrounding area came to its rescue and it is from here that the grand tradition of the special snake boat race in the area was born. The snake boat race in itself is an offering to Lord Krishna of Sree Parthasarathy Temple.\\n\\nThe snake boats used for this race are called Palliyodams. The credit for the design is given to Lord Krishna himself, the chief deity at the Aranmula Sree Parthasarathy Temple. He is said to have appeared on these shores on a raft made of six bamboos, giving the village its name – Aranmula or Six Bamboos.",

    "description": "Celebrated in the village of\\nChhapar, in Ludhiana district, Chhapar Mela is a nice blend of cultural ethos.\\nIn this fair, one would find everything to entertain themselves, right from\\ndelicious foods to fun games. Observed on the fourth day of Bhadra month,\\nthis Punjabi fair is majorly held in the memory of Gugga Pir who is also known\\nas Gogaji. He is a folk deity, mainly worshipped in the northern\\nIndian states like Rajasthan, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, Jammu, Gujarat, and\\nfew other places.\\n\\nGugga Pir is celebrated as a\\nwarrior-hero in local regions and is also revered as a saint or the snake\\ngod. \\n\\n\\n\\nHistory Of Chhapar Mela \\n\\n\\n\\nAccording to the legend, once\\nupon a time a snake and a boy were born together in an agricultural family\\nresiding in Chhapar village. It is said that both of them shared a very strong\\nbond of love with each other. Once, it happened that the mother of the boy went\\nto the fields for some work leaving him on the cot. To comfort the boy and\\nprovide him with some shade, the snake went stretching his hood on him. \\n\\nAt that moment, a local villager\\nwas passing by. Seeing the snake so close to the boy, he thought it is\\nthere to kill the toddler, hence he killed it. As they shared a mutual\\nbond of love, the boy also died a few moments post the snake's\\ndeath. After the deaths, the family members were advised by the village\\nelders to worship Gugga for the well-being of the child and since then this\\nfair is held in the saint’s memory.\\n\\n\\n\\nMajor Attractions Of Chhapar Mela\\n\\n\\n\\nAccording to the legends, it is believed\\nthat this fair came into being about 150 years ago by a few devotees of the\\nGugga Pir. Every year, it is celebrated in the month of Bhado or Bhadra.\\nAccording to the English calendar, the date of this event falls sometime in\\nSeptember. Lately, this fair has garnered too much attention for itself and the\\nnumber of people attending this fair has risen to millions. \\n\\nThe Celebrations of Chhapar Mela\\n\\nWith the onset of this fair, you\\ncan witness and indulge yourself in various activities from playing games to\\ndevouring scrumptious food items.

    "description": "The Andaman and Nicobar Islands are ideal tourist destination in India. Dominated by the tribals, the craft of the region, display the creative aspect of the tribals who dexterously and artistically work on crafts. The Andaman and Nicobar Islands is the finest place for those who love to collect different handicraft items from diverse places to beautify their interior or to keep them as a wealth. The forte of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands not only can be seen in their beauty but also could be establishing in the crafted items made by the local peasants. Cane and Bamboo: Bamboo is obtainable in plenty. Cane, too, is present in huge quantities but not for eternity easily available. Pandumas or Mellery, locally known as \"Kevadi\" grows to a big size and has long leaves. The islands also have a large number of coconut trees. The other natural resource is the sea wealth of the islands, which includes shells, coral, sea weeds and driftwood. The main types of shells existing are Turbos, Trancs, and Tortoise. Cane and Bamboo Work is carried on by settlers from  Kerala and Andhra Pradesh. They are able to make a variety of items according to designs provided. Left to themselves, they usually copy designs from old catalogues. Beautiful hole cane baskets made out of slim cane twigs that are not crack, are used by women for carrying market produce and for storage. A cheaper type is used by laborers engaged in building work. This is mostly furniture made to order. The total number of artists engaged in cane and bamboo work in the Andaman is probable at about 50.Wood Work : Carpentry is local to the Andamans, and the Administration also provides training in this line. Some units are engaged in making furniture and other articles out of ornamental woods such as Paduak, marble wood, Chui, etc. Tabletops made of Paduak burr are a novel item produced. A production centre under the industries department and a workshop of the Government saw mill at Chatham are the two large units responsible for the bulk of the produce. Shell Craft : Shell Craft is one of the most well-liked handicrafts of Andaman Islands. The shell crafts comprise ashtrays, lamps, buttons and jewelry made from the polished, attractive shells. The tortoise shell is the exciting resource substance accessible. These shells are large and available in beautiful shades. The articles like table lamps, small round and square boxes and some decorative items made from the tortoise shells are accessible. The items are mainly used for decorative purpose.Coconut Shell: Not long ago, the local industries department at Port Blair initiated training in making articles out of coconut shells. The items, which contain table lamps, finger bowls and other objects, have become quite popular. Jewellery made of coconut shell is another possibility, which may find a sell overseas market. As coconut trees are available in large records, they are the best natural resources for handicrafts of Andaman & Nicobar.Basketry and Mat Making : There are two important conventional crafts of the Nicobar, typically carried on by women in their free time. Mats are made from coconut stems and Pandanus leaves. They are used for sitting, sleeping and making huts. In the mats, very frequently light and dark leaves are interwoven to make an effectual pattern. These mats are soft light, and cool, and have a glossy surface.Cross Bows : Another useful craft is the making of crossbows which consist of a central beam of wood with grooves and iron loops to hold arrows and quiver, and a bow shaped arc made of thinner and lighter wood, its ends joined with a string. A trigger made of wood or bone is fixed to the lower part of the beam. The cross however, is used with one hand and can shoot up to 150 yards. Its novel design and trigger system make it a prized handicraft article for tourists.Present Scenario of Crafts of Andaman and Nicobar IslandsAndaman and Nicobar Islands handicrafts industry is mainly dependent upon its shell crafts. The shell crafted items of Andaman and Nicobar Islands handicraft industry enjoy high demand worldwide. The large quantity of small and big shells in the coastal areas has tempted the coastal people to indulge themselves in the practice of shell crafting. Thus Andaman and Nicobar Islands handicraft industry is a chief economic recourse for the local people.",

    "description": "According to Hindu Mythology, \" Ammavasai\" (no moon day) holds a lot of significance. On this particular day, the moon is not completely visible. Mahalaya Ammavasai is the name of the one new moon day that occurs each year. Sarva Pitru Ammavasai, Pitru Moksha Ammavasai, and Pitru Ammavasai are other names for Mahalaya Ammavasai. The festival of Dussehra begins on the Mahalaya Amavasya new moon day. This particular day is reserved for giving an offering in thanks to all the ancestors from prior generations who have made contributions to our way of living. During this festival lakhs of devotees throng at the banks of the River Kaveri, to offer the “Tharpanam” - an offering made to the divine entities.\\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\\n                            The Tharpanam includes water, sesame seeds, along with Dharba grass.\\nThe devotees also perform a unique ceremony of eating “Mann Soru”(eating boiled rice on the bare floor) in a vow to pray for good health. Every year on the occasion of Mahalaya Ammavasai lakhs of devotees gather to offer “Tharpanam” into the flowing water of River Kaveri, in remembrance of their ancestors.",

    "description": "Centuries ago there lived a king and a queen who had a hundred sons. It is believed that all the sons were killed in a war and the couple prayed to the goddess Lakshmi to be born as their daughter. Seeing the dedication of the couple, the goddess was born princess Lakshmi. She was named Bathukamma (live O child), was extremely beautiful and loved flowers. Ever Since girls and women in the household worshipped goddess Bathukamma with flowers.\\n\\nThe 9-day long festival not only celebrates life but also felicitates women. It starts on Mahalaya Amavasya and ends two days before Dussehra. It coincides with Navratri festivities. Bathukamma is a flower arrangement stacked in concentric circles. The flowers used are seasonal and have medicinal properties. The men in the family collect these flowers while the women arrange them on plates called Thambalam.\\n\\nEach of the nine days has a distinct name which is based on the Naivedyam (food offering) prepared. Most of these items are made with simple ingredients and children in the house are often a part of the process. It’s only on the 9th day - known as Saddula Bathukamma - the women of the house prepare a naivedyam consisting of 5 varieties of rice. On this day, women place the Bathukamma in the centre and dance around it singing folk songs. Before the sunset, they carry their nicely decorated Bathukamma and immerse them in large water bodies.\\n\\nBathukamma represents the true spirit of Telangana and hence it is also declared as a state festival.",

    "description": "If you want to experience a slice of the grandeur of the culture of the royal city of Mysuru, visiting the city during the famous Mysuru Dasara celebrations is a must. An annual festival that is spread over 10 days, brings alive the vibrant culture of the city and bathes it in a halo of effervescent beauty.\\n\\nDasara is a festival that celebrates the triumph of good over evil and is celebrated all over India. However, the magic of the Mysuru Dasara is on an altogether different level. Mysuru is the place to be during the Dasara festival. Mysuru Dasara celebrations go back many centuries in time and it is believed was started during the time of the Vijayanagara empire. The grandeur of the Dasara celebrations was further enhanced by the Wodeyar dynasty which ruled the erstwhile Kingdom of Mysore for over 5 centuries.\\n\\nWhat makes the Mysuru Dasara even more special is the mythological connection of the city to Mahishasura, the demon who was vanquished by Goddess Durga. The etymology of the word Mysuru which was later anglicized to Mysore links it to the legend of Mahishasura.\\n\\nAccording to the legend, the city that we now know as Mysuru was ruled by the Buffalo-demon named Mahishasura, who was a tyrannical and oppressive ruler. He also waged constant war against the Devas (Gods). The Devas then combined all their energies and out of this synergy was born Goddess Durga.\\n\\nThe Goddess waged a ferocious battle with the demon Mahishasura and after a fierce fight that spanned 9 nights (Navratri), Mahishasura was slain by her on the 10th day, which since then came to be celebrated as Vijayadashmi. The place where this battle between the Goddess and the demon took place is believed to have been the famous Chamundi Hills of Mysuru, and it is believed that the Goddess stayed on, in the hill as Chamundi Devi. A temple dedicated to the Goddess stands atop the hill on the outskirts of the city of Mysuru. Interestingly a statue of a fierce-looking Mahishasura, holding a naked sword in one hand and a snake in the other, is located near the Chamundi Devi temple on the Chamundi Hills.\\n\\nThe celebration of Dasara in Mysuru is now organised by the Karnataka State Government in conjunction with the royal family of Mysore. The festival is termed Nadahabba or State festival. The entire city is decked up and gaily decorated throughout the 10-day long festivities. The famed Mysore Palace is illuminated with 100,000 bulbs and glitters like a jewel, spreading its radiance far and wide. The palace becomes the cynosure of all eyes during the Dasara Festival.\\n\\nThe Mysuru Dasara with its kaleidoscopic experiences is an event that is a complete sensory experience that can only be had in the royal city of Mysuru, Karnataka.",

Navratri, meaning 'nine nights', is one of the most popular and widely celebrated Hindu festivals in many parts of India. Gujarat, however, is the only state that erupts into a nine-night dance festival, perhaps the longest in the world. Each night, all over the state, villages, and cities alike, people gather in open spaces to celebrate feminine divinity, referred to as Shakti.Navratri is dedicated to all the nine forms of Goddess Durga. Communities come together to dance in unison during garba, a seemingly simple dance, where the crowd moves together in a synchronized circular movement. Apart from religious and traditional significance, during these nine days, people show their best moves and do the garba and dandiya. One can hear the constant noise of sticks and dhols all over Gujarat for the nine long days. This Festival is universally loved and tourist special visit in autumn season for engaging themselves into the most entertaining and most loved festival of the country. This is the only festival which is loved by all the age group of people and people gather in big grounds and party plots for their most awaited festival.",

    "description": "Navaratri is one of the most revered Hindu festivals observed in the honor of goddess Lakshmi, Saraswati and Durga, also known as “Shakti”. It spans over nine nights during the month of sharada. Navaratri is said to be Gujarat’s one of the main festivals. The traditional celebrations include fasting for a day, or partially fasting each of the nine days by not eating grains or just taking liquid foods, in remembrance of one of nine aspects of Goddess Shakti.  \\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\\n                            In Gujarat, the prayers are offered and dedicated to Goddess Shakti in the form of Garbo as a remembrance of the womb of the family and universe. Commonly known as Garba, it is a traditional dance performed by the locals and is also accompanied by live orchestra, seasonal raga, or devotional songs. It is a folk dance where people of different background and skills join and form concentric circles. The circles can grow or shrink, reaching sizes of hundreds or thousands of people, dancing and clapping in circular moves in their traditional attire. Traditionally, women wear chaniya choli—a traditional Gujarati three-piece outfit comprising choli, a chaniya (long flared skirt), and an embellished dupatta (long scarf). Chaniya cholis are paired with glittering bangles, payals (ankle bracelets), necklaces, and belts. Mens wear chorno, kediyu or dhoti. The garba dance also deploys dandiyas , coordinating movements and the striking of sticks between the dancers. Men and women of all ages moved in synchronization and without missing a single step, they move like one giant whirligig. It was an eye catching mélange of grace, skill and poise.\\nUnited Way of Baroda is a local United Way set up in 1986, founded by Baroda Citizens Council with support from United Way International & UNICEF. United Way of Baroda is registered under Bombay Public Trust Act in 1998 & FCRA. Over three decades, United Way of Baroda is supporting communities, local NGOs and government for sustainable improvement in quality of life of less privileged people in and around Gujarat.

    "description": "Navratri, one of the major festivals, holds in honor of the divine feminine. 'Nava' means ‘nine,’ and ‘Ratri' means 'night’, Navratri occurs over nine nights during the month of Ashvin (as per Hindu calendar). This nine nights is that time of the year when people get the deep rest, which brings freedom from all kinds of botherations, deep relaxation, and creativity. Navratri is the time for worship of Devi, where Devi represents the omnipresent energy. It is believed that the prosperity that we enjoy in our daily lives is a manifestation of Devi and Devi Puja is the expression of expanded consciousness showing reverence to the whole creation. The main purpose of attending the puja is to give up all our worldly activities for a while and enter into deep meditation. Fasting, meditation, prayers, and other spiritual practices performed during this period help bring the deep rest.Devi is worshiped in nine forms known as ‘Nava Durga’. The importance of each day of Navratri is attached to a form of the mother divine. On the first day of Navratri, Devi Shailaputri is worshipped. In this form, Devi Parvati is revered as the daughter of Himalaya Raja. Shaila means extraordinary or rising to great heights. The divine consciousness represented by Devi always surges from the peak. Subsequently from second to seventh day, Brahmacharini, Chandraghanta, Kushmanda, Skandamata, Katyayani, Kalaratri, Mahagauri is worshipped during the auspicious time. On the ninth day, the last day of Navratri, Devi Siddhidatri is worshipped. Siddhi means perfection and it is believed that devi Siddhidatri makes the impossible, possible. Every year during the Navratri, Mahotsav is being organized at the Shree Umiya Mataji Ground, Unjha, Mehsana. According to the mythological tale, Maa Umiya was established by Lord Shankar himself at Unjha. In the year 156 BC Vikram Samvat- 212, King Vrajpal Sinhji constructed the temple. But the current temple was made with the contribution from each house Patidar Community house in the vikram samvat 1943. The construction of the temple was started by Shri Ram Chandra Mansukh Lal and after him, Shri Rav Bhahdur Bechardas Lashkari continued to construct the temple. Contribution was made by the Gaikwads Government and also by Patdi Darbar in these endeavors. The representatives of Gaikwad were present during the vastupujan of the temple, and they offered clothes to the deity.   In the year 1894 AD, the Man Sarovar was built. The place holds immense historic value and offers an exceptional experience to the visitors of the temple. Navratri Mahotsav is celebrated by lakhs of devotees in the temple premises; the place is lit up with colourful lights during the occasion. Pooja and Aarti are offered to the Maa Durga every day and it becomes one of the main attraction points of Mehsana. Garba, a special form of local dance, is being performed during all nine days of the celebration.",

    "description": "Navarathri or Nine Nights is a multifaceted festival celebrated across the State annually. Typically falling in either September or October, these 9 days are reserved for the special worship of the nine forms of Goddess Shakti / Devi. The final three days of Navarathri – Durgashtami, Mahanavami and Vijayadashami are set apart for the worship of Goddess Saraswati – the Goddess of wisdom and learning. Followers worship their work tools by keeping them in the pooja (worship) room and temples. Students at this time keep their books and other study materials in the pooja room and temples for worship. This unique practice is known as Ayudha Pooja (worshipping of vocational tools). \\n\\nOn Vijayadashami day, Keralites have their own special tradition. Words symbolising the name of God are written on the tongue of the child with a golden ring. The child is also made to write letters on a plate of rice with the help of elders. This practice is meant to introduce them to the world of knowledge and letters and is known as Vidyarambham. Ceremonies are performed in many places across the State to mark these festivities. Some of the important destinations for the same include Panachikkadu Saraswati Temple in Kottayam and Thunchan Parambu in Malappuram, Attukal Bhagavathy Temple in Thiruvananthapuram, Guruvayur Sree Krishna Temple in Thrissur and Chottanikkara Devi Temple in Ernakulam.",

    "description": "Durga Puja, also known as Dussehara or Vijayadashmi, is an annual Hindu festival which reveres and pays homage to the Hindu goddess Durga and is also celebrated because of Durga's victory over Mahishasur. It is particularly popular and traditionally celebrated in the Indian states of West Bengal, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh (eastern parts), Jharkhand, Odisha, Tripura, Assam and the country of Bangladesh. The festival is observed in the Indian calendar month of Ashwin, which corresponds to September–October in the Gregorian calendar. Durga Puja, is a ten-day festival, of which the last five are of the most significance. The puja is performed in homes and public, the latter featuring a temporary stage and structural decorations (known as pandals). The festival is also marked by recitations, performance arts, revelry, gift-giving, family visits, feasting, and public processions .As per Hindu ures, the festival marks the victory of goddess Durga in her battle against the shape-shifting asura, Mahishasura. Thus, the festival epitomizes the victory of good over evil. Durga puja coincides with Navaratri and Dussehra celebrations observed by other traditions of Hinduism, in which the Ram Leela dance-drama is enacted, celebrating the victory of Bhagwan Ram against Ravana, and effigies of Ravana are burnt.",

    "description": "Mysuru Dasara was originally started in Srirangapatna in 1610 by Raja Wadiyar. It shifted to Mysuru only in 1799, when the capital was shifted back to Mysuru, after the fall of Tipu Sultan.\\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\\n                            \\nThe historical, annual Srirangapatna Dasara was celebrated in a grand manner, complete with the procession of folk troupes and Jamboo Savari in the town.\\nThe procession passes through Kiranguru, Baburayanakoppalu, and Bengaluru-Mysuru highway, Kuvempu Circle, Bypass Road opposite Jamia Masjid, Rajabeedhi, Ambedkar Circle, and Mini Vidhana Soudha and reached Ranganathaswamy temple.\\nSrirangapatna Dasara festival showcases the rich Heritage, culture, Tradition of old Mysuru Region.History says that Dasara celebrations in Karnataka actually began in a tiny town called Srirangapatna under King Raja Wodeyars rule in 1610 Srirangapatna was then the capital of the Wodeyar dynasty and it remained so for the next century However in the late 17th century Mummadi Krishnaraja Wodeyar shifted the capital to Mysuru and with that the grand Dasara celebrations moved there too However the villagers continued to have lowkey celebrations during the nineday festival But in 2009 owing to huge demand from the villagers a threeday Dasara celebration including Jamboo Savari was held in the town.Srirangapatnams first Wodeyar Dasara was held from a Banyan tree at Puragiri on the outskirts of Srirangapatna to the Ranganathaswamy temple at Srirangapatna in all pomp and glory The Goddess Chamundeshwari idol was atop a decorated elephant The festival was not held for 10 days Raja WodeyarI wanted to call off these festivities as he had lost his son The celebrations were held but they were sombre This was the first Dasara held close to Mysuru in 1610 Though the procession was just 2 miles it marked the beginning of the Mysuru Dasara  \\nThe Wodeyars were confined to Srirangapatna till 1799 until Tipu Sultan was killed in the 4th AngloMysore war From  1761 to 1799 they were under Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan Dasara festivities were allowed during this period under the strict supervision of Tipu Under his watchful eye it was seen that they never became popular with the public After Tipus death the Wodeyar were installed as a puppet monarchy under the British rule from 1799 to 1831 and then they moved to Mysuru They built a palace of wood during this period and Dasara celebrations became a huge affair From 1831 to 1881 they ruled from Mysuru as a titular monarchy under the British They were an absolute monarch between 1881 to 1947 ruling from Mysuru but under the British rule The old wooden palace which was ravaged by fire was rebuilt and the structure stands strong to this day",

    "description": "On a social, cultural, and artistic level, Durga Puja is perhaps unlike any other religious festival in India. The underlying idea is to celebrate the homecoming of the goddess Durga as she makes her annual visit to her parents’ home with her four children Saraswati, Lakshmi, Ganesh, and Kartik, but in practice, it is the biggest socio-cultural festival of Bengal, cutting across all barriers. It is indeed a cultural heritage that has only grown stronger with every passing year.\\n\\nAccording to most scholars, Durga Puja in Bengal dates back to the medieval era (at least 11th century AD), though Bengal broke with tradition by performing the ritual in Autumn, whereas it was originally meant for Spring. Apparently, the unseasonable ritual was begun by Lord Rama, hero of the Ramayana, when he performed the puja in Autumn as part of his war against the demon king Ravana. Initially the preserve of rich aristocratic families, Durga Puja in its present form probably began in Bengal in the 16th century, when renowned zamindar Raja Kangsanarayan organised a lavish festival at a cost of nearly Rs 8 lakh at Taherpur in Nadia district towards the end of the century.\\n\\nOther landed aristocrats followed in his footsteps. In 1606, a Puja was organised by Bhabananda Majumdar of Nadia, an ancestor of the celebrated Raja Krishnachandra Roy. Kolkata probably got its first Durga Puja in 1610, courtesy Laxmikanta Majumdar, the founder of the Sabarna Roy Chowdhury family. This family is inextricably linked to the founding of Kolkata, since it was from them that the British East India Company acquired the rights to three villages – Sutanuti, Gobindapur, and Kalikata – which went on to become the city of Calcutta, later Kolkata.",

The festival epitomizes the victory of good over evil, though it is also in part a harvest festival celebrating the goddess as the motherly power behind all of life and creation.  Durga puja is an old tradition of Hinduism. The Durga Puja, is a ten-day festival of which the last five are of the most significance. The Puja is performed in homes and public, the latter featuring a temporary stage and structural decorations (known as Pandals).   It is particularly popular and traditionally celebrated in the Indian States of West Bengal, Tripura, Jharkhand, Odisha, Assam, Bihar and the country of Bangladesh.",

It was decided\\nthat the dispute will be settled by a music and dance competition between the\\ntwo tribes. The tribe which would lose would have to leave the area. The fight\\ncontinued for seven days and seven nights in which the Oraons came out\\nvictorious, due to the possession of a special musical instrument, Mandar which\\nthe Mundas did not have. However after winning, the Oraon asked the Mundas to\\nnot leave and stay together peacefully. But the Mundas did not agree. They kept\\ntheir word and migrated to Khunti.",

    "description": "Devara Hipparagi is a town in the Vijayapura (Bijapur) district of Karnataka. The town is known for its sacred and ancient temples which number around 40. The most important of these temples are the Ravutaraya temple and the Mallayya temple.\\n\\nThe Ravutaraya-Mallayya Jatrotsava or annual fair of the historic town is a famous celebration that has been going on for more than a thousand years. Thousands and thousands of devotees gather for this annual fair from far and wide in Devara Hipparagi town. The festival is spread over 5 days and begins on the 12th day (Dvadashi) of the lunar calendar, after Vijayadashmi.\\n\\nThe highlight of the fair is a procession of the deity Ravutaraya from the Ravutaraya temple to the Mallayya temple. It is a grand procession with devotees offering flowers and garlands. An interesting aspect is that the devotees have undertaken a padayatra to collect the flowers and offer them to the deity. There is loud cheering and dancing with devotees from far and wide participating enthusiastically.\\n\\nThe procession then circumambulates at a Banni tree before entering the Mallayya temple. According to tradition, the wedding ceremony of Ravutaraya and Gangemalammar takes place here.\\n\\nThe historical significance of the fair and the celestial wedding is found in the Sanskrit text Mallari Mahatme. According to this reference, Ravutaraya was known as Marthanda Bhairava. It was Lord Shiva himself, who incarnated as Marthanda Bhairava to kill the evil Mani Mallasuras. He assumed the form of a horse and killed Mani Mallasura. His mother was Gange Malamma, also known as Ghee Malamma.\\n\\nThe ancient temple of Mallayya is the centre of the entire fair and has some ancient relics. These include a 70 feet high lamp post known as Mahalagumb or Deepasthambh which is believed to be of the period of Adil Shah. There is also an ancient Tamarind tree which is almost a thousand years old.\\n\\nA visit to Devara Hipparagi during the Ravutaraya-Mallayya Jatrotsava is a walk back in history. It is an experience that connects you with the ancient heritage and culture of the region.",

    "description": "International Kullu Dussehra\\n\\n\\nDussehra is one of the important festivals of India. It is celebrated differently at different places. The Kullu Dussehra in Himachal Pradesh is a weeklong festival celebrated in October, is a special occasion and an opportune time to witness different shades of the valley’s vibrant culture.\\n\\n\\n\\nRich in history and cultural heritage, Kullu, with an average altitude of 1200 meters, nestles in a valley that is sheltered by the Pir Panjal and the Greater Himalayan ranges. Known as valley of Gods, Kullu is also famous for its cottage wool weaving industry, the Kullu Shawl and Kullu Caps are worn the world over and have come to associate a brand identity with the valley.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Kullu Dussehra is however, markedly different from rest of the country as the weeklong festival begins on the day it ends elsewhere. Started in the 17th century, the tradition was established when Raja Jagat Singh installed an idol of Lord Raghunath that had been brought from Ayodhya at the palace temple in Kullu.\\n\\nCelebrated with great fanfare, more than 300 deities (‘Devtas’-Gods & Goddesses) of Kullu district, participate and pay their obeisance to Lord Shri Raghunath ji, the Principal deity of Kullu valley. The festival gets underway with the arrival of Goddess Hadimba from Manali, but the main function is that of the Lord Raghunath, colourfully dressed, riding into the ground in a hand pulled wooden chariot. The local Administration invites the deities to participate in the festival.\\n\\nDuring the festival cultural troupes from various States and folk dancers from abroad give their performances. A large number of National & International tourists also visit Kullu during this festival. The Kullu Dussehra has been accorded an international festival status.\\n\\nDuring the festival, Rath Yatra, exhibitions put up by various Govt. Departments and NGO's, Sports meet and local marts displaying handicrafts and other local products etc. are the major attraction of the festival.\\n\\nKullu can be reached by road and air. The Kullu-Manali airport is at Bhuntar (10 km) from Kullu. Chandigarh-Manali highway passes through Kullu. It is 270 km from Chandigarh and 220 km from Shimla.\\n\\nPlaces to stay: ‘Hotel Sarvari’ and ‘The Silvermoon’ are run by Himachal Tourism and offer a comfortable stay in Kullu.

    "description": "Dussehra is a Hindu festival celebrated all over the country. As the name suggests, it is the ‘Tenth Day’ of the fierce battle fought; when Lord Rama killed King Ravana. This holy day marks the victory of good over evil. The Dussehra Festival of Kota is quite a unique experience for both, the residents and tourists. Villagers dress themselves in colourful traditional wear and join long processions to offer their prayers to Lord Rama. Cultural programmes are organised and include scintillating performances by well-known artists. However, the highlight of the festivities is the theatrical representation of the encounter popularly known as ‘Ramleela’. The drama is so highly anticipated among the locals that spectators start chanting the name of Lord Rama during the show. The climax of the show holds most appeal as it ends with setting alight gigantic effigies of the 10-headed Ravana along with his brother Kumbhkarana and his son Meghnath. These 75-feet tall statues are stuffed with crackers and once set on fire, they burst to create an extravagant show.",

    "description": "Anthurium Festival\\n\\nThe most popular festival celebrated in Mizoram, the Anthurium Festival is a successful tourism promotion venture of the Tourism Department. This three-day festival is held annually at the Tourist Resort Reiek, located in Reiek, a quaint and picturesque village which is about an hour's drive from the state's capital, Aizawl. Truly representing the state, it is celebrated as a festival amidst nature during the peak season of the beautiful and exotic anthurium blossom. Best described as an extravaganza of culture, music, dance, games, fashion shows, handloom and handicrafts exhibitions, and traditional cuisines, it is set against the majestically verdant backdrop of Reiek Mountain, blooming in a kaleidoscope of colourful anthurium flowers.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe inception of the Anthurium Festival is the large-scale production of anthurium flowers by the Mizo womenfolk. It is because of the efforts of the Horticulture Department, Government of Mizoram, that the anthurium flowers grew to be so popular. Serving as an initiative to help support housewives to become financially independent, this cultivation instantly gained popularity and eventually led them into the export business. The cut flowers are of the highest standards as compared to the rest of the country. Thus, came the establishment of the Zo Anthurium Growers Society in Mizoram. These cut flowers are exported to various parts of the country and even abroad. The Tourism Department, in collaboration with the Horticulture Department, launched the Anthurium Festival in 2006 to recognize and popularize this movement",

    "description": "Maharishi Valmiki JayantiValmiki is revered as the first poet of Sanskrit literature. He was a great sage and author of the epic Ramayana which consists of 24,000 verses and 7 cantos (Kandas) including the Uttara canto.\\nValmiki is also known as Maharishi Valmiki and considered as the Adi Kavi i.e. the first poet of Sanskrit language.\\nMaharishi Valmiki is believed to be the contemporary of Lord Sri Rama which makes it difficult to define the exact timings of his birth as birth era of Lord Sri Rama is also a topic of much debate among modern historians. However his birth anniversary which is also known as his Jayanti is celebrated on Ashwin Purnima as per Hindu lunar calendar.\\nAs per Ramayana, Shri Rama met Valmiki during his period of exile and interacted with him. Later, Valmiki gave shelter to Devi Sita in his hermitage when Rama banished her. Kusha and Lava, the twin sons of Shri Rama were born in his hermitage. Valmiki taught Ramayana to both twins.\\nMaharishi Valmiki in his early life was a highway dacoit named Ratnakar, who used to rob people after killing them. It is believed that sage Narada Muni transformed Ratnakar into great devotee of Lord Rama. On the advice of Narada Muni, Ratnakar performed great penance by reciting great Mantra of Rama Nama. After years of meditation, a divine voice declared his penance successful and bestowed him with new name Valmiki, the one who born out of ant-hills.",

    "description": "Deepotsava or Deepotsavam, commonly known as the festival of lights, is held every year in the month of Kartika (October - November). It is a month-long festival remembering Damodara-lila, the sweet pastime of baby Krishna stealing butter and consequently being tied to a mortar by his dear mother Yashoda. In Sanskrit, \"dama\" signifies rope and \"udara\" means belly. Damodara refers to Krishna, who was bound with a rope by his mother Yashoda.\\n\\nThe splendours of Kartika month cannot be adequately described. Devotees maintain strict vows (Damodara Vrata) and worship Lord Damodara by lighting a ghee lamp every day during this month. Offering a lamp to Lord Hari in the month of Kartika is considered to provide endless prosperity, beauty, and wealth. All the sins committed in thousands and millions of births are forgiven, and one enters the eternal spiritual state where there is no suffering.\\n\\nEvery day throughout this month, the temple is adorned with thousands of lamps. The light from hundreds of lamps placed before the altar cast transcendental radiance across the main temple hall, boosting the spirit of devotion. The splendour with which the festivities are carried out captures everyone's devotion.\\n\\nThe altar is briefly closed at 7:30 PM,  followed by a Deepotsava Festival announcement. The significance of this festival is explained to the gathered followers. The devotees begin singing melodious kirtans as soon as the announcement is made, and the altar is opened. Everyone is captivated by the magnificent sight of Their Lordships Sri Radha Krishnachandra in the midst of smoke. A grand arati is performed as the devotees sing the Damodarashtaka song. Following the arati, the assembled devotees are given the opportunity to offer ghee lamps to Their Lordships. This is followed by Shayana Pallakki Utsava.",

    "description": "He was born in October 1670 in a Rajput family doing farming in village Rajouri, district Punch, State of Kashmir. He was named Lachman Dev. As a child he was very fond of horse riding, martial art, hunting and was expert in use of bow and arrow and other weapons used in wars at that time.\\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\\n                            At the age of 15 years while hunting a she-deer and tearing the belly of the deer, he saw twin unborn off springs writhing in pain and dying in front of his eyes. He was so much moved of this happening that he left hunting and became an ascetic. His father was a kind religious person and used to give free food and shelter to the visiting saints, sadhus and holy persons. Lachman Dev's attention turned towards them.\\nHe became follower of Sadhu Ram Daas of Ram Thamman near Lahore (now in Pakistan). After some time he followed Janaki Daas. His name was changed to Madho Daas. While moving from place to place, he reached Punchvati near Nasik in Maharashtra and became follower Sadhu Aughhar Nath. Madho Daas served Aughhar Nath with full devotion for 5 years. Aughhar Nath pleased with his services, bestowed him with all his virtues, occult powers and even his own created holy book. Aughhar Nath expired in 1691. Thus at the age of 21 years, Madho Daas, the Rajput youth attained miraculous powers and reached Nander to set up his own Ashram.\\nThus living at Nander since the last 16 years, in the year 1708, a the age of 38 years, Madho Daas with lot of miraculous powers and fame was a master of a big Ashram and was very proud of his wisdom, meditation, occult powers and fame. He started insulting, putting down all saints, sadhus, intellectuals, faquirs etc. who so ever came to his Dera.",

A peculiar feature of the lake is the presence of a large number of huge turtles in the lake. The lake is a habitat to turtles, birds, other aquatic life, floura and fauna etc. There are several temples located on the periphery of the Lake. On the eastern bank of Mansar Lake there is a shrine dedicated to Sheshnag, a mythological snake with six heads. Newlywed couples consider it auspicious to perform three circumambulations (Parikarma) around the lake to seek the blessings of Lord Sheshnag. Two ancient temples of Umapati Mahadev and Narsimha and a temple of Durga are also situated in the vicinity of the Mansar Lake, which are visited by devotees in large numbers. People take a holy dip in the water of the lake on festive occasions. Certain communities of Hindus perform the Mundan ceremony (first hair cut) of their male children here. Boating facilities for recreational purpose are also available in Mansar Lake. There is a wild life sanctuary housing wild life including Spotted Deer and Neelgai and water birds such as Cranes and Ducks. One can also witness the traditional and typical distinct life style of Gujjar and Bakarwals wearing ethnic costumes, living in open Kulhas in the hills around Mansar Lake. The Tourism Department takes pride in organizing and exposure event for the Deaf Children and Adults at Mansar on 16.10.2022 to reduce the stress level among these children and adults. By organizing such activities for disable persons, a message is spread among other such persons across the country so that other organizations can also initiate such stress reliving activities for disabled persons.",

    "description": "Every year, on the second Monday of October, the Church of Our Lady of Mercy, in Colva, celebrates the Colva Fama. A feast of the celebration of infant Jesus. During the feast, a wax statue of the infant Jesus is brought down from the altar and venerated by the devotees. Folks say the statue has miraculous powers.According to a 17th-century legend, a Jesuit priest and sailor, Fr Benito Fereirra, sj. found the statue off the coast of Mozambique. When Fr. Benito got  posted to the church of Our Lady of Mercy, in Colva, Goa, he brought the statue with him and enthroned it on an altar in the church. Later, when he was transferred to the Rachol seminary, he took the statue with him to the seminary. The villagers begged him to return the statue but he refused. Disappointed, the villagers made their way back. On their return journey, they found a diamond ring (the same ring that was on the finger of the infant Jesus). They rejoiced, went back, made a replica of the statue and put the ring on its finger. Parishioners of the nearby villages of Colva, Sernabatim, Gaundalim and Velim, contributed towards building a separate altar for the statue. To this day they still venerate that statue, which they say has miraculous powers.",

    "description": "Guru Har Rai was born on January 16, 1630, in Kiratpur to Baba Gurditta the eldest son of Guru Hargobind. From a very young age, he exhibited sensitivity to all living things and endeared himself to his grandfather Guru Hargobind. Thus, living a life of humility, Guru Har Rai Ji inspired others to do the same.\\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\\n                            Guru Har Rai Sahib was the son of Baba Gurdita Ji, the eldest son of Guru Hargobind, and Mata Nihal Kaur Ji(also known as Mata Ananti Ji). His father died when he was just 8 years old. He spent his life at his birthplace of Kiratpur. He would spend his morning and evenings listening to devotional music and giving lectures on the writing of the Gurus. He was fond of hunting but never kill the animal whereas keeping them as pets in his zoo.\\nThe Guru would also eat simple food which was earned by the labor of his own hands. Followers from far would come to Kiratpur to seek his blessings. Guru Har Rai also traveled a lot in order to spread the message of Sikhism to the masses. He sent Bhagwan Gir to eastern India to preach Sikhism. Another disciple Bhai Pheru was sent to Rajasthan and Suthre Shsh was appointed to Delhi. Guru Har Rai also had the challenge of maintaining unity within the Sikh party, as his older brother continued to cause problems over the years, trying to split the Sikh movement. He started several public singing and ure recital traditions in Sikhism. The katha style recitals were added by Guru Har Rai, to the sabad kirtan tradition. He also added the akhand kirtan of continuous chanting as well as the tradition of jotian da kirtan a Satsang singing of ures.\\nHe loved nature and the story related to it was once Guru Har Rai as a young boy accidentally battered a flower in his garden with his gown. He was very much hurt by this incident and loved and preserve nature and started the medicinal herb garden known as called Naulakha Baagh.\\nWhen Mughal emperor Shah Jahan’s eldest son Dara Shikoh was seriously ill, Guru Har Rai sent a herbal medicine which cured him. Guru Har Rai was asked why he was helping the Mughal prince Dara Shikoh whose forefathers had persecuted Sikhs and Sikh Gurus. Har Rai is believed to have replied that if a man plucks flowers with one hand and gives them away using his other hand, both hands get the same fragrance. The emperor Shah Jahan was very much pleased with Guru and forget his enmity and vowed that he would never again cause him annoyance. ince Ram Rai had proved a disappointment to his father, Guru Har Rai appointed his younger son as the next Guru. Har Krishan became the eighth Guru at age 5 after Guru Har Rai’s death because of natural causes on October 6, 1661. The Sikh devotees were inconsolable at the untimely death of Guru Har Rai and it was the new Guru Har Krishan who consoled the followers, telling them to accept God’s will.",

    "description": "Guru Har Krishan was of a small age when he attained the leadership of the Sikh people. There are very few devotees of God in human history who have achieved a high level of spirituality in such small age. Prahlad, Dhruv was one of them and Guru Hari Krishan can also be included in the same list. All other Sikh Guru’s sat on the “Gaddi”, the “throne of Guruship” when they were over the age of 12, but only Guru Hari Krishen sat on the Gaddi when he was just 5 of age.\\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\\n                            \\nWhen Guruji stayed in Delhi there was a smallpox epidemic which resulted in many deaths. By Guru ji’s blessing, the lake at Bangla Sahib provided a cure for thousands. Exposing himself to his many devotees he too died succumbed to smallpox. Thus he unselfishly, without the thought of danger to himself, served many people. This is true Sewa to care for the sick even at the risk of one’s own life.\\nGurdwara Bangla Sahib was constructed in Guru ji’s memory. This is where he stayed during his visit to Delhi. This was originally the palace of Raja Jai Singh, who was a strong and powerful Sikh and a devotee of the Guru.\\nGuru Sahib caused the illiterate water-carrier Chhaju Ram to expound the philosophy of the holy Gita on challenge from Pandit Lal Chand. On hearing this narration of the holy Gita, Pandit Lal Chand was deeply humiliated. He was so impressed with this feat performed by the Guru that he became a Sikh and later escorted the Guru Sahib to Kurukshetra.\\nGuru Har krishan Sahib was born on Sawan Vadi 10, (8 Sawan), Bikrami Samvat 1713, (Wednesday, 23 July 1656) at Kiratpur Sahib. He was the second son of Guru Har Rai Sahib and Mata Krishan Kaur Ji (Sulakhni Ji). Ram Rai, the elder brother of Guru Harkrishan Sahib was ex-communicated and disinherited due to his anti-Guru Ghar activities, as stated earlier and Sri Harkrishan Sahib Ji at the age of about five years, was declared as Eighth Nanak Guru by his father Guru Har Rai Sahib before his death in 1661.\\nGuru Har Rai passed away on 20 October 1661. Guru Har Krishan consoled the disciples. He asked them not to give way to despair but abide by the Will of the Almighty. All should sing God’s praises and not weep or lament. As days went by, the disciples began pouring in from far and near. They were delighted to have a sight of the Guru. He sat on the throne, a small figure, young in years, but mature in wisdom.",

Approximately five to six thousand tourists from the outskirts come to attend the festival in Almora town. Showing the symbolic victory of the truth the effigies of devils are prepared in a very artistic manner in almost all the ‘Mohallas’ (wards) of the town. Finally, at a social gathering, all these effigies are burnt. The festival is generally celebrated in October.  Before burning the effigies, the entire procession is taken out in the city with music bands. It is so famous that tourists from across India and outside the country also visit Almora to see this spectacular moment. This tradition started in 1975 when locals started contributing effigies to other members of Ravana.",

He had the privilege of being blessed by the first six Gurus. He led an ideal Sikh life for more than a hundred years. He was one of closest companions of the guru Nanak (the first Guru of Sikhism) and is one of the most revered and sacred saints in Sikhism. He holds one of the most important and pivotal positions in Sikh history. The first head Granthi of Sri Harmandir Sahib.\\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\\n                            \\nBaba Buddha ji was a most venerated primal figure of early Sikhism, was born on 6 October 1506 at the village of Katthu Nangal, 18 km northeast of Amritsar. Bura, as he was originally named, was the only son of Bhai Suggha and Mai Gauran.\\nAs a small boy, he was one day grazing cattle outside the village when Guru Nanak happened to pass by. According to Bhai Mani Singh, Sikhan di Bhagat Mala, Bura went up to him and, making obeisance with a bowl of milk as his offering, prayed to him in this manner: “O sustainer of the poor! I am fortunate to have had a sight of you today. Absolve me now from the circuit of birth and death.” The Guru said, You are only a child yet. But you talk so wisely.” “some soldiers set up camp by our village,” replied Bura, “and they mowed down all our crops – ripe as well as unripe. Then it occurred to me that, when no one could check these indiscriminating soldiers, who would restrain Death from laying his hand upon us, young or old.” At this Guru Nanak pronounced the words: “You are not a child; you possess the wisdom of an old man.” From that day, Bura, came to be known as Bhai Buddha, buddha in Punjabi meaning an old man, and later, when advanced in years, as Baba Buddha.",

Legend says that on this day, the sixth Sikh Guru, Guru Hargobind Ji and 52 other princes came back to Amritsar after being released from prison by Mughal Emperor Jahangir.Golden Temple, in itself, is a beautiful marvel to see. But on the day of Diwali, Golden Temple is so illuminated and serene as if gods themselves were showering the light. One must visit the Golden Temple in Amritsar on this day. Purchase some earthen lamps, light them around the sarovar and partake langar when here. It will prove to be so surreal and an experience like you’ve never had before. One can also go shopping around the Heritage street market to purchase Parandis, Phulkari dupattas, Punjabi Juttis and many more such items.Diwali and the Bandi Chhod Diwas are celebrated in the Hindu Month of Kartik. The festival is generally celebrated for 4-7 days. This year, Diwali will be celebrated on October 24.",

Oil lamps are lighted with the help of firewood in the temple, and it is believed that the light is visible from the Chamundi Hills in Mysore. \\n\\nThe annual fair or Deviramma Jathre takes plae for for four days during which the Rathotsava or Car Festival is also held.

    "description": "Govardhana Puja is celebrated to commemorate the feat of Lord Sri Krishna lifting the Govardhana Hill to protect the residents of Vrindavana from the wrath of Indra.When the Supreme Lord Sri Krishna saw the residents of Vrindavana preparing for Indra-yajna, He suggested that they should forgo the worship of Indra and instead worship the Govardhana Hill. On coming to know of this, Indra became angry and sent a devastating rainfall over Vrindavana. Krishna picked up the Govardhana Hill with His little finger and it gave shelter to all the inhabitants of Vrindavana. Indra became conscious of his offense and begged for forgiveness from Krishna. Thus the Supreme Lord established that a devotee who is surrendered to the Supreme Lord and engaged in devotional service is free from all obligations and need not worship any demigods for material favor. This pastime is known as Govardhana Lila and is described in the tenth canto of Srimad Bhagavatam.\\nDevotees prepare varieties of foodstuffs with grain and ghee (like rice, dhal, halva, pakora, puri, etc.) and all kinds of milk preparations (such as sweet rice, rabri, sweet balls, sandesh, rasagulla and laddu). The food is stacked like a small hill and offered to the Lord. Then it is distributed to everyone as prasadam. Hence, this festival is also called Annakuta Festival.Devotees also worship the cows on the day of Govardhana Puja.\\nThe Deity of Lord Sri Krishna is decorated in Giridhari alankara, holding the Govardhana Hill on the little finger of His left hand. The devotees of Hare Krishna Mandir Ahmedabad make a replica of the Govardhana Hill with egg-less cakes and a variety of cookies prepared in the temple’s own bakery. The Govardhana cake is offered to the Deities of Sri Sri Radha Madhav and later distributed to all the devotees. The cows are well decorated and offered worship. An arati is performed for Gopala, the protector of the cows. Devotees sing various songs like Yashomati Nandana. The Govardhana pastime is narrated to everyone. A grand arati is performed for Krishna Balarama while the devotees sing Sri Govardhanashtakam – eight verses glorifying the Govardhana Hill.",

The holy text spans 1430 pages and contains the actual words spoken by the founders of the Sikh religion (the Ten Gurus of Sikhism) and the words of various other Saints from other religions including Hinduism and Islam.\\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\\n                            \\nGuru Granth Sahib was given the Guruship by the last of the living Sikh Masters, Guru Gobind Singh Ji in 1708. Guru Gobind Singh said before his demise that the Sikhs were to treat the Granth Sahib as their next Guru. Guru Ji said – “Sab Sikhan ko hokam hai Guru Manyo Granth” meaning “All Sikhs are commanded to take the Granth as Guru”. So today, if asked, the Sikhs will tell you that they have a total of 11 Gurus. (10 in human form and the SGGS).\\nWhen one visits a Gurdwara (a Sikh temple), the Guru Granth Sahib forms the main part of the Darbar Sahib or Main Hall. The holy book is placed on a dominant platform and covered in a very beautiful and attractively coloured fine cloth. The platform is always covered by a canopy, which is also decorated in expensive and very attractive coloured materials. The text in which the Granth is written is a  called Gurmukhi (literally “From the Guru’s mouth”), which is considered a modern development of the ancient language called Sanskrit.Guru Nanak brought the “Word of God” to manifest upon Earth. Through his Hymns and Prayers (Shabads), he inspired and uplifted humankind to live a life of truth, righteousness and spirituality. These enlightening words were sung by his companions, Bala and Mardana, and by the Sangats (congregations) tha grew up around Guru Nanak. In his later years at Kartarpur, it became customary for the members of the Sikh community to sing certain hymns on a daily basis: Japji in the morning; So Dar and So Purakh, the beginnings of Rehiras, in the evenings.\\nGuru Angad, Guru Amar Das and Guru Ram Das all composed Shabads (hymns), and the Sikhs began to collect these in small books, called Pothis. Chanting these Shabads, the Sikhs became vehicles for the vibrations of the “Word of God”, and they achieved a state of higher consciousness, a transcendent meditative union with God and Guru.",

This festival generally starts on the seventh day of Kartik, as stated in the Hindu calendar, and ends on Kartik Purnima.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\\n                            As part of the Sama-Chakeva festival, sisters in groups bring the soil dug by their brothers from the fields and hills near settlements and make various types of artistic idols and images of Sama and Chakeva (in the form of birds) from it, later painting them with various colours and, after completing rituals on Purnima, submerging them in rivers.It has another important significance as well, because migratory birds from the Himalayas are seen in the plain region. They symbolise Sama and Chakeva.The locals sing, dance, and retell the folklore, wishing good health and well-being to their brothers and sisters.",

Local Bullock art owners and farmers arrange this race mostly in their villages. \\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\\n                            Bullock cart owners pay  obeisance to   Shri Nageshwar during Vaikunth Chaturdashi Yatra at Awas.\\nThe Maharashtrian version of bullock cart racing was known as Bailgada Sharyat, a 450-year-old tradition of the farmers of Konkan, western Maharashtra and Marathwada. Four incredibly fast bulls pull the cart for a distance of 350-450 feet on the racing track, and the team with the highest speed is considered winner. Each team dashes across the tracks one at a time and most of the finish the race in around 10-15 seconds. It requires  a strong grip, excellent balance, and astonishing bravery to hold on to the carts as the bulls rushed towards the finish line. Clouds of dust and loud cheers fill the environment with pulsating energy.\\nThe organising  of these races is  not a small task either. The racing track or Ghat has to be carefully prepared, days in advance. Veterinarians are brought in to inspect the bulls, so as to ensure that the animals are  in prime physical conditions. These cattle races formed an integral part of the Jatras or village fairs that were held between Makar Sankranti and the Monsoon months, a time when the farmers were not busy in the fields. Sometimes, the races are  organised as solo events instead of being a part of a village fair. The money that is  raised by the races is  utilized for the betterment of the village and for the renovation of the local temples. In this manner, cattle racing in India is  an adventure sport that also helped to raise funds for social causes.",

    "description": "Jagaddhatri is another representation of Goddess Durga and is worshipped on Shukla Navami tithi of the Bengali month of Karthik. The Goddess Jagaddhatri (The one who is holding on to the Earth) does not represent a violent form as that of Durga. She is seated on her Vahana Lion which stands upon the Elephant representing the Karindrasura (MahaGaja).\\n\\nThe erstwhile French colony of Chandernagore on the crescent moon shaped banks of the river Hooghly located in the district with the same name in West Bengal state has also nurtured a unique festival of Goddess Jagaddhatri in late autumn with the tallest of idols reaching the height of thirty feet approximately since the mid eighteenth century. In Bengal, worship of Goddess Durga is undertaken thrice in a year. First During Basanti Puja in the Bengali Month of Chaitra, Secondly during the SharadiyaDurga Puja in Autumn, and thirdly the Jagaddhatri Puja in late Autumn on Shukla Paksha of Bengali month of Karthik.Jagaddhatri, meaning the saviour of the universe is another form of the Goddess Durga who comes to save mankind from the demonic reign of the Asuras or evil spirits. The interesting aspect of this festival is that the traditional ornamentation and painting style of the Goddess has remained the same over the years with the use of the Shola and DaakerSaaj being an integral part till the present day. Several craftsmen over the years have created lighting decorations with the help of combined expertise of mechanical and electrical engineering during the four days of the festival concluding with the elaborate immersion procession that spoke of its grandeur globally and thereby spreading its glory to various parts of the world where such work has been exhibited.",

It is a place of great religious and historical significance and is one of the main religious sites for the followers of Sikhism. This Gurudwara attracts a large number of pilgrims from far and wide areas. It falls on the Jalandhar-Batala road, around 7 km south of the city of Batala.\\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\\n                            The legend of Gurudwara Achal Sahib is older than the gurudwara's physical existence. The annual fair on the occasion of the holy festival of Shivratri had and has been taking place near the site of the gurudwara since years. During one such annual celebration, Guru Nanak- the first Sikh Guru and the founder of Sikhism- came to visit the place himself become a part of the celebration. Siddh yogis used to live in the area in huge numbers at that time.\\nSince the Shivratri fair had made a great name for itself for its grandeur and spiritual fervor, the great Guru Nanak traveled to witness it all in front of his eyes. It is said that the moment Guru Nanak entered the town, word of his presence spread all across town and people started chanting the Nanak name. Earlier, only songs and hymns to honor the holy saint were heard and sung by the townsfolk but never had any of them seen him in person. Therefore, when they found out that it was actually him, they flocked to catch a glimpse of the divine soul in great numbers and meet him in person to seek his blessings. Seeing all the attention of the public focused solely on Guru Nanak, the yogis felt jealous and got offended. They decided to confront him in front of everyone so that they could assert their superiority and went to meet Guru Nanak with Bhangar Nath, their leader.",

This retinue is referred to as the pooram.\\n\\nThe festival begins with the arrival of poorams from the ten temples. Dazzling display of elephants and percussion music accompany every pooram. One of the key highlights of the festival is the quick and rhythmic changing of colourful parasols in a ceremony called the Kudamattom ceremony.\\n\\nAnother spectacular ceremony at the festival is a local performance called Ilanjithara Melam where hundreds of artists perform an orchestra accompanied by traditional musical instruments. The spirit of the ceremony is further mirrored by thousands of spectators who wave and sway to the music and create an absolutely magical moment.

The Akhil Bhartiya Kalidas Samaroh is held every year in the winter season.\\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\\n                            \\nAkhil Bhartiya Kalidas Samaroh attracts many people, both from the country as well as from abroad. Several dramas are staged during this event that depict a wide array of themes, social, socio-political, cultural etc. The Indian classical programs also find many stalwarts performing besides some performers whose journey into the musical arena has just begun.\\nAkhil Bharatiya Kalidas Samaroh of Ujjain takes pride in its association with Kalidas, the greatest poet of the country. Kalidasa was a poet who has contributed heavily to the Sanskrit literature. In his works, this great poet has pictured the beauty of life and pondered how we can offer pleasure to others by way of our liberal and graceful behavior. His portrayals are heart- warming, vivid and his word power is pretty unique.\\nDr. Rajendra Prasad, India's first President inaugurated the festival when it was held for the first time in the year of1958. The first Prime Minister of India, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru did the honors of inaugurating the second Akhil Bharatiya Kalidas Samaroh in Ujjain. It was largely the scholarly enthusiasm of Pandit Suryanarayana Vyas that is held responsible for this festivals' establishment.",

    "description": "Sant Namdev (known as Namdeo or Namadeva) (29 October) (1270 - 1350) or Bhagat Namdeo is a poet-saint from the Varkari sect of Hinduism. He is also venerated in Sikhism. He was born on October 29, 1270 in the state of Maharashtra village of Narasi-Bamani, in Hingoli district (presently called Narsi Namdev). His father, a calico printer/tailor (Bhavsar), was named Damshet and his mother's name was Gonai / Gonabai. \\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\\n                            Most of the spiritual messages of Namdev emphasized the importance of living the life of a householder and that through marriage and having a family, one could attain Moksha.\\nHistory\\nThe first biographer and auto-biographer in Marathi and the foremost proponent of Bhagawad-Dharma who propagated the religion right up to Punjab. Saint Namdev, a contemporary saint-poet of Saint Dnyaneshwar, is considered a prominent religious poet of Maharashtra. He was one of the earliest writers who wrote in the Marathi language. He is the foremost proponent of the Bhagwad-Dharma who reached beyond Maharashtra, right into Punjab. \\nHe also wrote some hymns in Hindi and Punjabi. His depth of devotion and talent in delivering Kirtan was of such a high standard that it is said even the Lord Pandurang swayed to his tune. Despite being a proponent of the Warkari sect, Saint Namdev established religious unity across the country.\\nSaint Namdeo was born in the year 1270 in the village of Narasi-Bamani, now located in the Hingoli District in Maharashtra. He was born to a tailor named Damasheti Relekar and his wife Gonai. Yadusheth, his ancestor in the seventh generation, was a devotee of Bhagawad-Dharma. Soon after his birth, his family moved to Pandharpur, where the prominent temple of Lord Vitthal (also called Vithoba) is located. Saint Namdev’s spent the better part of his life, spanning eighty years, at Pandharpur. His parents were devotees of Vithoba.\\nNamdev showed little interest in the family profession. Even as a child his devotion to Lord Vitthal was extraordinary - his sole occupation was to spend day and night in devotion to Vithoba. His devotion was so sincere that sometimes he would consider Vithoba to be his dearest brother or his playmate. \\nAccording to a legend, when Namdev was five years old, his mother once gave him some food offerings for Vithoba and asked him to give them to Vithoba in the Pandharpur temple. Namdev took the offerings and placed them before Vithoba's idol in the temple, asking Vithoba to accept the offerings. \\nWhen he saw that his request was not being met, he told Vithoba that he would kill himself if Vithoba continued to ignore the offerings. Vithoba then appeared before him and ate the offerings in response to the utter devotion of young Namdev.",

For example, if one man offers 12 pieces of meat to his friend, it shows that he treasures his friendship, it is reciprocated, and if he is also offered 12 pieces of meat, it means that the friendship is valued by both sides.",

It is said that from this place, Guru Nanak Dev continued his journey towards Northern India.\\n\\n\\nAccording to Sikh Mythology, when Guru Sahib reached the bank of the holy river Narmada, the local king denied giving  him a boat  to cross the river. Upon the denial of the king,  Guru Sahib asked Bhai Mardana to lay a Chadar on the waters of holy Narmada. Bhai Mardana obeyed the order given by Guru and both of them crossed the river on the chadar.  The king was left astonished after seeing this. Thereafter, Gurdwara Sahib has been named as Chadar Sahib. A big Langar Hall has been constructed in the premises of the Gurudwara Sahib.

The Tamil month of Karthigai, which takes place between the months of November and December, is significant in the South Indian states' religious and spiritual traditions. The Arulmigu Arunachaleswarar Temple at Thiruvannamalai hosts a 10-day festival called Maha Deepam or Annamalai Deepam. In this temple, Lord Shiva is worshipped under the name \"Arunachaleswarar.\" This temple also holds the privilege of representing one of the five cosmic elements. Lord Shiva is believed to be present at Thiruvannamalai in the form of a mountain, signifying the element of fire in the cosmos.The other four temples representing the cosmic elements are located at: Thillai Nataraja Temple in Chidambaram(sky), Jambukeswarar Temple in Thiruvanaikaval(water), Ekambareswarar Temple in Kanchipuram(Earth), and Srikalahasti Temple in Andhra Pradesh (Wind). The 10-day celebrations commence on the day of Uttradam with the flag hoisting and Lord Arunachaleswarar is carried in procession atop the silver vahanas. The Panchamurthis (Panchamurthigal) - Lord Ganapathi, Lord Murugan, Lord Sandheswarar, Lord Arunachaleswarar, and Goddess Parvathi are also carried upon chariots during the procession.  Each day, these processions are done on a variety of vahanas, including the Lord Indira's chariot, the Indira Vimanam, the Simha vahanam, the chariot of the lion, the Kamadhenu Vahanam, the Rishaba Vahanam, and the Kailasa Vahanam. On the tenth day, the famous Bharani Deepam with its five \"Agni Deepams\" is lit in the temple of Arunachaleswarar's Sannithi. On the festival's last day, lakhs of devotees gather in the Annamalai Hills to worship the Maha Deepam.",

Before the 1962 Indo-China war, Tibetan gold, rare gemstones and Tibetan artefacts used to be traded for wheat, salt and other Indian merchandise at the fair. Penetration of roads and closing of the Indo-Tibetan border has reduced the fairs traditional wares.In the evenings, cultural nights are held where troupes put up entertaining performances. ‘Natti’ dances and cultural shows are the main attractions.Getting there: Rampur can be reached by road only and is 130 km from Shimla. The nearest airport and railhead is at Shimla.Sarahan (40 km approx), a tourist destination, is easily accessible from Rampur.Far below in the valley tumbles the river Sutlej. Across lie the snow-covered Shrikhand peaks and a host of other mountains that divide the Sutlej and Beas valleys. This is an area closely connected with the epic Mahabharata and the exile of the Pandavas. Sarahan itself is surrounded by fields and orchards, and small villages with remarkable examples of local architecture. Sarahan is revered as one of the fifty-one Shaktipeeths and the temple of Sri Bhimakali is a resplendent example of indigenous building skills.

Sand Mandalas are made using millions of grains of coloured ‘sand’ made from powdered stone placed painstakingly into intricate designs using hollow metal funnels called chagpurs. Mandalas are used as an aid to meditation, during which the monks visualise transforming themselves into the deities represented in the design. Once the initiation and meditation is complete, the mandala is destroyed illustrating the principle of the impermanence of all things",

He repeatedly defeated invasions by Muslim armies, particularly those arriving from Afghanistan, and established friendly relations with the British.\\nRanjit Singh’s reign introduced reforms, modernisation, investment into infrastructure, and general prosperity.His Khalsa army and government included Sikhs, Hindus, Muslims and Europeans.

Every year, the sleepy hamlet of Kalpathy in Palakkad bears witness to a grand festival. Elaborately ornate and giant chariots trundle through the streets of Kalpathy, carrying the resident deities of the land. Hundreds wait in reverence to watch this ritual named Kalpathy Ratholsavam (Chariot Festival) that dates back to centuries.Celebrated at the Sree Vishwanatha Swamy Temple at Kalpathy in Palakkad, the ten-day long festival features the grand procession of temple chariots through the streets of the village. The temple is among one of the oldest worship centres of the Hindus in Kerala. The festival is dedicated to the presiding deity of the temple Vishwanatha Swamy or Lord Vishnu. Lord Siva and Goddess Vishalakshi are the main deities of the temple, and they are taken out in these chariots. A week-long Carnatic music festival is also organised along with this.The festival is celebrated at Kalpathy Agaraharam, the Tamil Brahmin settlement area of Palakkad in Kerala. These giant chariots command all the attention during the festivities. Festooned with flowers, mirror work, trinkets and other decorative objects, these temple chariots are a sight to behold. The devotees team up to lug these chariots through the narrow streets of the heritage village of Kalpathy. The chariots are taken around the village on the last three days of the festival. The final day sees beautifully decked-up chariots from nearby temples, located in the villages of New Kalpathy, Old Kalpathy and Chathapuram, also joining in the festival. This rare meeting of the temple chariots is called Devaratha Sangamom, meaning “meeting of the Lords,” and is one of the much-awaited events of the festival. All the six temple chariots bearing the deities are then brought to the Sree Vishwanatha Swamy Temple.",

    "description": "Gauchar Mela started in 1943 and was inaugurated by the then Deputy Commissioner Mr.Barnedi. Traders from the Tibetian regions of Dapa, Diphu, Gyaning, and Tholing would sell wool, deer musk, shilajit, black salt, along with numerous ayurvedic products. However, due to problems with India and China in 1962, the trade with Tibet stopped.Due to the leveled flat land of Gauchar, it served as an airstrip in the past. The queen of the region while returning from Badrinath decided to use the land as a grazing field. She bought the land from the villagers and since then, it was used as a grazing field. The name Gauchar originated after that. Gauchar was the property of Panwar kings until they donated the land to Badrinath Temple. The land is still under Badrinath Temple and it is not supposed to be used for any type of agricultural or agricultural-related activities. Significance of Gauchar Fair Gauchar Mela is one of the most important trade fairs of Uttarakhand. The fair begins on 14 November and continues for a week or so. As Gauchar Fair exhibits the arts and crafts of different regions of Uttarakhand, it plays a vital role in promoting trade and culture of Uttarakhand. Particularly an industrial fair, Gauchar Fair encourages cottage industry by providing a platform for the people to display their products in front of local inhabitants, traders, and tourists.",

The temple is known as Dakshinakasi of the south. (Kasi is considered the holiest of Hindu pilgrim centres, which is in Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh). But come December the temple and its surroundings will be all the more gorgeous, for it is the time of Vaikathashtami - the twelve-day annual festival. The festival falls in the Malayalam month of Vrischikam, corresponding to the months of November / December.The legend behind this festival is that years ago a saint man named Vyaghrapada prayed to God Siva for\\nyears after many years God Siva and his wife Parvathy Devi appeared in front of him. It is believed that god\\nSiva appeared in front of him in the day of Krishna Ashtami. So as a memory of this Vaikathashtami is\\ncelebrated. 12th day of 13 days festival is celebrated as Vaikathashtami. The festival starts with Thrikkodiyettu (Holy Flag Hoisting\\nceremony). Sreebali and Vilakku will be held in the following\\ndays. On Fifth, Sixth and Seventh day, Poothalam Varavu is\\nheld. One of the major highlights during the festival is the\\nAshtami Vilakku or lamps. Another major ritual during the\\nfestival is the Udayanapurathappante Varavu (arrival of Lord\\nMurga (Subrahmanya) from the\\nnearby Udayanapuram Subrahamanya Temple) to pay\\nrespects to his father Lord Shiva at the Vaikom Temple.\\nPanchavadyam, Gajapooja, Aanayoottu etc will ba held as a\\npart of the festival.

    "description": "The festivals of India are a mirror of the unique cultural diversity of the country. They form a part of India’s rich intangible heritage. One of the really unique festivals happens in Karnataka’s capital - Bengaluru. For 3-days every year the famous Bull Temple Road in South Bangalore literally becomes a sea of groundnuts. This marks the celebration of the Kadalekayi Parishe or Groundnut Festival, an event that has been celebrated for five centuries now.\\n\\nKadalekayi Parishe literally translates as “Groundnut Fair,” and this is indeed a fair in its true sense. The fair is deeply rooted in the history and culture of the region and evokes the simple ethos and gratitude of the farmers reaping the bounty of their crops.\\n\\nThe Kadalekai Parishe happens in the month of November or December, the dates vary as the festival is celebrated according to the Hindu calendar. The festival is celebrated on the last Monday of the month of Karthika according to the Hindu calendar. The stretch of the Bull Temple road near the famed Dodda Ganesha Temple in Basavanagudi and the Bull Temple is marked by farmers selling huge heaps of groundnuts, fresh from the fields, on either side of the road.\\n\\nThe origin of the Kadalekai Parishe dates back to the time of Kempegowda, the founder of Bengaluru. A fascinating story is associated with the genesis of the Kadalekai Parishe.\\n\\nAccording to legend, centuries ago, the groundnut farmers of the region were in a quandary. After they had worked hard in the fields and when it was time to reap the harvest of groundnuts, to their dismay, they would find their crop destroyed.\\n\\nIt soon came to their notice that the culprit was a raging bull that went berserk in their fields and damaged their crop. As a solution to their woes, the farmers worshipped and prayed to Nandi, the bull who is the vehicle of Lord Shiva and the guardian of Kailash, the abode of Lord Shiva.\\n\\nAs appeasement, the farmers started offering their first crop to an idol of Nandi. This was the beginning of what we know today as Kadaleykayi Parishe. A temple was built over the Nandi Idol by Kempe Gowda, which is famous today as Basavanagudi or Bull Temple. The practice of offering the first crop to Nandi continues to this day.\\n\\nThe initial practice of offering the first crop of groundnut to Nandi, soon metamorphosed into a complete fair, where families would go to buy fresh groundnut and also have a great time in the carnival-like atmosphere that would prevail in the area.\\n\\nToday, the centuries-old fair still retains its original and earthy flavour and gives a glimpse of the culture of old Bengaluru. Farmers from nearby villages converge on the Bull Temple road. After praying at the Basavanagudi and offering their first crop to the deity, they set up a stall on the roadside.",

    "description": "Every year, on the third of December, the feast of St Francis Xavier is celebrated which marks the death anniversary of the Saint. This annual festival, known as the Feast of St Francis Xavier or Goinchea Saibache Fest, (Lord of Goa Festival), is the biggest of all the Christian festivals in Goa.   He was canonized with St. Ignatius in 1622 by Pope Gregory XV and named the patron saint of all foreign missions by Pope Pius X. He died of a fever on a Chinese island in 1552, at just 46 years old, and was brought back to Goa a few years later. In 1614, by the order of Superior General of the Society of Jesus Claudio Acquaviva, his right arm was severed at the elbow and taken to Rome, where an altar was made to display it in the Church of the Gesu. He lends his name to many schools, parishes and Jesuit communities worldwide, including Xavier High School in New York City and Xavier University in Cincinnati. In 1637 his body was laid to rest in a silver casket, constructed by Goan silversmiths. The casket was placed in the Basilica of Bom Jesus where it remains to this day. Once every ten years there is a public exposition of his body, the next being due in 2024.",

    "description": "Guru Gobind Singh ji was born as “Gobind Rai” and was the tenth and last of the ten human form Gurus of Sikhism. He became our Guru on November 24, 1675 at the age of nine, following in the footsteps of his father Guru Teg Bahadur ji.In1675, Aurangzeb who had ordered the forced conversion of all Hindus and thought that if the respected Kashmiri brahmins under the leadership of Pandit Kirpa Ram accepted Islam, others in the country would be easily converted. They had been given six months to decide or suffer the consequences. Time was running out. The Brahmans mad in desperation by the religious fanaticism visited Anandpur to seek Guru Tegh Bahadur’s advice.As the Guru sat reflecting what to do, young Gobind Rai, arriving there in the company with his playmates, asked why he looked so preoccupied. The father, as records Kuir Singh in his Gurbilas Patshahi 10, replied, “Grave are the burdens the earth bears. She will be redeemed only if a truly worthy person comes forward to lay down his head. Distress will then be expunged and happiness ushered in.”“None could be worthier than you to make such a sacrifice,” remarked Gobind Rai in his innocent manner.Guru Tegh Bahadur advised the brahmins to return to their village and tell the authorities that they would accept Islam if Guru Tegh Bahadur could first be persuaded to do so.\\nSoon afterwards the Guru with a few followers proceeded to the imperial capital, Delhi. After watching the tortured deaths of three of his followers, he as well, refused to convert and was beheaded on November 11, 1675.",

    "description": "The Rengmas commemorate the Ngada festival for eight days just after the harvest.  It is the festival of thanksgiving and rejoicing. The Ngada festival is an agricultural oriented celebration. It marks an end to the harvest season of the year. The festival is overseen as a time for the people to rejoice, dance, sing, celebrate, feast and forgive. The celebrations last for seven to eight days, varying from place to place in Nagaland. The village high priest (Phensengu) heralds the beginning of the festival at the top of his voice, so that the villagers can prepare themselves for it.\\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\\n                            \\nFor the Rengmas, Ngada is the mother of all festivals. Aptly, the mother of each household has to taste the newly harvested grains during this year- ender festival before anyone else does. A deviation from this ritual means angering he spirits, so does ignoring other female kin. It made sense to pamper the women; the onus was on them to prepare delicacies and zu (rice beer) to last the entire festive phase.\\nThe highlight of the festival, though, was Ngada Kenyhundzon. It required all able-bodied men, dressed in their war and ceremonial costumes, to visit all Rensis (Morungs) in a village. The women, also in their fineries, followed closely behind carrying the baskets filled with meat and the potent Nkhezü (rice beer), apparently to keep the men’s spirit high. The choicest food, however, would be saved for visitors, who could not get away without eating to their heart’s content.",

According to the Puranas, Maharaja Vasu Chakraborty of Basrur was married and did not have children for many years. Desiring children, the king vows to build a temple in Koteshwar if he begot children. In the course of time, the king is blessed with progeny. \\n\\nIn keeping with his vow, he goes on to build the temple, however as the chariot or Brahma Ratha for the temple was not readied in time, the king gets a chariot made of bamboo and sugarcane bagasse. The Kodi Habba is held to commemorate this incident from mythology. \\n\\nThis festival takes place during the period known as Kodi Month in the local language of Kundapur. Usually, this fair is held in the last week of November or the beginning of December. Most of the people who come to this festival do not return home without taking sugarcane. The festival is held in a grand manner and takes place during the day and night. Many cultural programmes are also held. The town of Koteshwar is decorated with lights and thousands of people come every day. Exhibitions of juggling and acrobatics are also an interesting part of the Kodi festival.",

During December to March, many Olive Ridley turtles come to the western coasts of Maharashtra and lay their eggs. These eggs are then guarded by a group of volunteers against predators and poachers. Eggs naturally hatched within 50 - 60 days and the hatchlings will then be released to the sea. Previously they were either sold in the markets or were destroyed by dogs, but now these conversation efforts helped the rise of the Ridley family. And in this regard, the Olive Ridley Turtle Conservation festival is celebrated with great vigour.",

    "description": "Located 84 kms north of Udaipur in the wilderness, Kumbhalgarh is the second most important citadel after Chittorgarh in the Mewar region. Cradled in the Aravali Ranges the fort was built in the 15th century AD by Rana Kumbha. The inaccessibility and hostility of the topography lends a semblance of invincibility to the fort. It served the rulers of Mewar as a refuge in times of strife. The fort also served as refuge to King Udai of Mewar in his early childhood when Banbir killed Vikramaditya and usurped the throne. It is of immense sentimental significance for the people being the birthplace of Mewar's legendary king Maharana Pratap. The fort is self-contained in all respect to withstand a protracted siege. Its defences could be breached only once by the combined armies of the Mughal and of Amber primarily for scarcity of drinking water. There is a magnificent array of temples built by the Mauryas of which the most picturesque place is the Badal Mahal or the palace of the clouds. The fort also offers a superb bird’s eye view of the surroundings. The fort's massive wall stretches some 36 kms with a width enough to take eight horses abreast. Maharana Fateh Singh renovated the fort in the 19th century. The fort's large compound has very interesting ruins and a walk around it can be very educative.",

    "description": "This two-day festival is organized annually by the Department of Tourism, Government of Mizoram, at the Tuirial Airfield which is an abandoned airstrip located located about 21 kilometres from Aizawl's City centre. Celebrated usually during the second-last weekend of November, it is designed to showcase the culture and culture and traditions of Mizoram along with a variety of entertaining shows.\\n\\n\\nThe Winter Festival was originally known as \"Thalfavang Kut\". The essence of Thalfavang Kut reflects the close unit society and deep camaraderie that knits the Mizos together no matter where they are. The origins of this festival are deeply rooted in the tough and courageous past of the Mizos. The State was gripped by serious insurgency in the 1960s and 70s. This displaced families from their homes, villages and towns. Several Students had to seek refuge in neighboring states where they continued with their education. Not only did they have to adjust to a completely different society, but were also haunted by the tragedies they witnessed at home along with a yearning for the lush green hills of their home state. These students thus birthed the idea of Thalfavang Kut, an annual festival that was held wherever the Mizo diaspora lived. After getting together, they would perform traditional dances, sing folk songs, share their experiences, encourage each other and, at the end of the day, share a feast.\\n\\nToday, the Winter Festival is celebrated with a plethora of activities, games, music and entertainment. Other features of this festival include exhibition of handlooms and handicrafts, traditional dances and music, performance by well-known artistes and bands, carnivals, and local cuisine, to name a few. The main highlights of this entertaining festival are hot air ballooning and powered hand gliding: both of which are not to be found anywhere else in the north east of India. To add to the long list of activities is the annual MIMSA Motor Sports racing which also takes place during the festival.",

It is a 2 days annual event usually held in the last week of June or the beginning of July.\\n\\nThe Javadhu Hills in Tamil Nadu are an extension of the Eastern Ghats and extend to parts of Vellore and Tiruvannamalai districts in the northern part of the state. Vellore and Tiruvannamalai districts are separated by this range. This hill is located between an altitude of 3,600 and 3,800 meters. Tourists flock to the cliffs and precipices of hills to witness stunning views. The hill consists of the bluish-grey granite. You can also visit Beema Falls, Komutteri Lake, Kavalur Observatory, Amirthi Forest, and the Glass House in this hill zone.\\n\\nIn these hills, Jamanamarathur is one of the larger villages, with about 10,000 inhabitants. During the Jawadhu Hills summer festival, Jamanamarathur is found to be the most decorated one. Lights will be floating on the lake, and fireworks will also be displayed. In addition to children's games and food stalls, there will be a special kids' zone where all kinds of kid's cartoons and play areas are created artificially to attract children.\\n\\nThe Jawadhu Hills summer festival is usually organised in an open space and on a massive level so that the general public can enjoy it to their fullest. The State government actively participates in making this year's festival a hit.\\n\\nFrom revenue, education, health, animal husbandry, agriculture to the Police and cooperatives, all government bodies join hands to plan the Jawadhu Hills Summer Festival well in advance.\\n\\nThe festival observes different cultural programs like traditional folk dance (Bharatanatyam, Silambattam, Puliattam, Thappattam, Oyilattam, and Kolattam) and drama. There will be several troupes performing folk songs and dances. There are dedicated areas for outdoor sports like Volleyball, Kabaddi, and some for indoor games. Not to miss the free health camps are also organised for the visitors. The state and central welfare schemes would be promoted through multi-department stalls.\\n\\nTaking note of the beauty of the Jawadhi hills, Henry le Fanu wrote about the hills in 1883.

Here, the whole concept of worship revolves around the Parabrahma or the universal consciousness. It is this uniqueness that makes this temple stand apart from the rest. The highlight of the festival, at this temple, is the mock battle between two groups, to the sound of drums, in a waterlogged field called padanilam. This battle commemorates the historic battle, fought between the erstwhile Kayamkulam and Ambalapuzha kingdoms. The event features boys and men, split in two groups, who jump into the field, to engage in a mock battle. In this mock battle, sticks replace swords and the participants splash muddy water at each other. The festival is held on the first two days of the Malayalam month of Mithunam (Mid June).",

    "description": "Cycling Trail -Bicycle touring is possibly the finest method to truly experience a region's landscape and culture, so the Tamil Nadu Tourism Development Corporation (TTDC) collaborated with the Chennai-based cycling group, Cycling Yogis, to map theme-based trails inviting all cycle enthusiasts in the city. The insightful concept of heritage cycling trails was developed by incorporating diverse heritage themes to enhance awareness of heritage and cultural connections within Chennai, and also with the motive of embedding a healthy lifestyle while boosting the importance of responsible tourism among peers. The first phase of the heritage cycling trail was held from March 2022 to May 2022. The trails are categorized country-wise to understand the history behind the overseas arrivals and their contribution to the city. Some of the trails included in the initial cycling trail were: Portuguese, Armenian, American, and George Town Trail of Madras. The cyclists rode between 25 and 40 kilometres along each trail. Despite the fact that TTDC had limited the number of participants to 25 initially, all four trials in the first phase received an enormous response from the general public, and TTDC had to cater to nearly twice the audience in the second phase of the trail. The second phase of the trail was planned from June 2022 to August 2022.

    "description": "Alluri Sitarama Raju was an Indian revolutionary who waged an\\narmed campaign against British colonial\\nrule in India. Born to a Telugu speaking family on 4th\\nJuly 1897 at Bhimavaram in present-day Andhra Pradesh, he became involved in opposing the British in\\nresponse to the 1882 Madras Forest Act, which effectively restricted the free\\nmovement of Adivasis (tribal communities) in their forest\\nhabitats and prevented them from practicing a traditional form of agriculture\\nknown as PODU. \\n\\nRising discontent towards the British led to the Rampa Rebellion of 1922, in which he played a major part as a leader.\\nMustering a force combined of Adivasis, farmers and sympathizers to their cause,\\nhe engaged in guerilla campaigns against the British colonial authorities in\\nthe border regions of the Madras Presidency part of the districts of East Godavari and Visakhapatnam (now part of Alluri Sitharama Raju district). He was nicknamed \"Manyam Veerudu\" (Hero\\nof the Jungle) by local villagers for his heroic exploits.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nAlluri adopted aspects from the Non-cooperation movement, such as promoting temperance, and the boycott of\\ncolonial courts in favour of local justice, administered by panchayat courts, to attract people's support.\\nAlthough the movement died out in early 1922, it had reached the plains area by\\nthen, as he was involved in the propagation of some of its methods among the hill people, to raise their political consciousness, and\\ndesire for change. These actions caused him to be put under the surveillance of\\npolice, from around February of that year, although the fact that he was using\\nthem as a camouflage to foment armed uprising seems to have not been recognized by either the movement, or the political leadership of the British.After putting up a massive effort for nearly two years,\\nthe British finally managed to capture Alluri in the forests of Chintapalle, he\\nwas then tied to a tree and executed by shooting on 7 May 1924 in the village\\nof Koyyuru. A tomb of him currently lies in the village of Krishnadevipeta,\\nnear Visakhapatnam. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe heroic efforts of young Alluri in\\nfighting an all-out war without any state powers, against one of the most\\npowerful empires have been recognised by all. The British\\nGovernment grudgingly acknowledged him as a powerful\\ntactician of the Guerrilla warfare which lasted for nearly two years, the fact\\nthat they had to spend over 40 lakhs in those days to defeat him.",

    "description": "The Great Indian Film and Literature Festival, GIFLIF, is Asia’s first film and literature festival. The inaugural edition was launched in Gurugram in December 2015. With over 1800 film entries from 108 countries and 16 sessions that focused on the numerous facets of film-making such as screen-writing, direction, lyrics and the journey of the artists, GIFLIF was much appreciated by the audience of 7,000. Having no precursor to a film and literature festival, GIFLIF’s progression was only possible with experimentation in terms of execution and content. Gurugram International Film and Literature Festival were soon rechristened to The Great Indian Film and Literature Festival. The name being changed because GIFLIF was now set to be a travelling festival, focusing also on regions that have no dearth of talent, but lacked exposure to any major festival. GIFLIF Bhopal Chapter was launched in September 2016, attended by around 7,000 people, young and old.\\n\\nBeing in the circuit for over a year, the founders realized the monotony of discussions and debates that had become an integral part of electronic, digital and live events across India. The thought now led to curation of content that was enriching and entertaining. Elements such as plays, music concerts and poetry recitals came into being at GIFLIF. Ace poet, author, actor and composer, Mr. Piyush Mishra, who had been a mentor since the inception of GIFLIF launched his musical project, Ballimaaraan, at GIFLIF Gurugram Chapter 2016. A moment that GIFLIF celebrates till date. The audience of Gurgaon relived their childhood with an evening of poetry with Hasya Kavi Surendra Sharma. The play Nothing Like Lear, directed by Rajat Kapoor and enacted by Vinay Pathak was a treat to the audience. India’s only Oscar nominated animated film “Schirkoa” directed by Ishan Shukla, and The School Bag – Directed by Dheeraj Jindal were the some of the path breaking films that were screened with the directors.\\n\\nGIFLIF Bhopal Chapter was conducted in August 2017. The edition was a celebration that Bhopal had never witnessed. Be it eminent author Mr. Ruskin Bod’s first visit to Bhopal in 83 year or the first ever performance of Ballimaaraan. Neeraj Arya’s Kabir Café, which is the only band to exclusively perform saint Kabir’s dohas, to a show with mentalist Abhishek Acharya. The edition was a massive hit with over 15,000 people in attendance. This led us to an invitation from the neighbouring state Chhattisgarh. GIFLIF was launched in Raipur in January 2018, and the junta of Raipur was in for the first edition of GIFLIF in their city. With an attendance of over 15,000 people GIFLIF had made a mark.\\n\\nAfter 7 editions across numerous cities Gurgaon (2015, 16), Bhopal (2016, 17, 18), Raipur (2018, 19) and GIFLIF Drive-In Music Festival India’s First (2021) World Record by Harvard. GIFLIF is again coming in new Avtar GIFLIF Comedy and Music Fest 2022.",

    "description": "Gurudwara Qatalgarh Sahib (Shahid Ganj), west of Garhi Sahib, is the main shrine at Chamkaur Sahib. This marks the site where the thickest hand to hand fight took place on 7 December 1705 between the Mughal army and the Sikhs, including the Sahibzadas, Ajit Singh and Jujhar Singh, and three of the original five Piare (the Five Beloved). A gurdwara was constructed here by Sardar Hardial Singh of Bela in 1831 but that building was replaced during the 1960’s by a new complex raised under the supervision of Sant Piara Singh of Jhar Sahib and later of Sant Bishan Singh of Amritsar. The main building called Mariji Sahib is an elegant three storeyed domed structure standing upon a high base. The large divan hall contains an eight metre square sanctum. Another vast hall close by is called Akal Buriga. It was used for the daily congregations before Mariji Sahib was constructed. To the west of Akal Buriga is an old Baoli Sahib still in use. The Guru ka Langar, community kitchen, is further north from Baoli Sahib and Akal Buriga. The Gurdwara also houses the offices of the local managing committee which administers all historical shrines at Chamkaur under the overall control of the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee. In addition to the daily services, largely attended assemblies take place on the first of each Bikrami month and on important anniversaries on Sikh calendar. A three day fair called Shahidi Jor Mela is held on 6,7 and 8 Poh, usually corresponding with 20, 21 and 22 December, commemorating the martyrs of Chamkaur.",

The first three days are considered the most important ones when people also visit monasteries to make offerings and seek blessings. Ladakhis from all religions celebrate this festival with full fervour.  As the tenth month of the Tibetan lunar calendar stepped into the Himalayan kingdom of Ladakh the people welcomed the New year with all their hearts Whereas the smells of culture that detonated softly in our memory like poignant land mines hidden somewhere fainted as the growl of cars and loud speakers tainted with blending of so called modern album songs overwhelmed the peace.",

    "description": "Like all festivals, Christmas is celebrated in a deeply spiritual and fulfilling manner in Prasanthi Nilayam, Puttaparthi, and observing it only makes one ponder deeper about why we celebrate this holy day. In the true spirit of the Christian tradition, the Prasanthi Christmas is focused on the birth and life of Jesus Christ, the beloved son of God, and his teachings of love and forgiveness. What makes this celebration holistic is the fact that Christians from all over the world, speaking different languages, descend upon the divine valley to celebrate the most sacred day in the Christian calendar in the divine presence of the Poorna Avatar, Bhagawan Sri Sathya Sai Baba. They are joined by seekers from every possible faith who share the spirit of the season, resonating Bhagawan Baba’s call that there is only one religion, the religion of love. In the abode of Bhagawan Baba, the entire task of bringing alive the spirit of Christmas through sights, sounds and love is shouldered personally by teams of dedicated Sai devotees.",

It is also a  photographer's delight.\\nThe winterline is a sharp line in the sky which is more like a faux horizon line. So before the sun actually sets across the real horizon, in this part of the world, it disappears across a faux horizon. Dehradun Valley is warm so the hot air rises up, while the air in the sky around Mussoorie is very cold during winter. As air with different temperatures meet, it gives rise to a sharp line - the lower part is dark, and the cooler air is light blue. This line is always there, but just before sunset, due to refraction of light, the line lits up beautifully as a golden sharp line while the sun disappears behind the lower portion of the sky which is dark in color. \\nEvery winter evening, scores of visitors can be seen gazing towards the Doon valley from the Mall Road (in Mussoorie) in awe and amazement at this meteorological phenomenon.\\nThus this carnival is truly a 'one-stop-shop' during the holiday season.",

The temple complex is on the foothills of a mountain chain bordered by greenery in all sides. At the entrance of the temple of Shree Shantadurga Kunkalikarin, there is a massive doorway called Mahadwar. The temple has the big gold plated kalash that is built on the main dome with ornamented designs. In the garbhagraha, there are two statues of Shree Shantadurga. One is in a sitting position and the second idol of the Devi is in standing position. The same is the Darshanamurti because the devotees can take darshan of her daily. This statue is made up of the five metals. She is standing on a patt. She holds a trishul, sudarshan chakra and an arrow in her hand.\\nThe annual 'Zatra' falls in the month of Pausha Shuddha Navami and attracts thousands of devotees and tourists from all over the world.

This effort was supported by the Japanese. During the Second World War, the Japanese Imperial Force occupied the Andaman & Nicobar Islands on 23rd March 1943. Thereafter the Japanese Prime Minister on 6th November 1943, at the Assembly of Greater East Asiatic Nations, in Tokyo, declared that the Andaman and Nicobar Islands would be transferred to the Provisional Government of Azad Hind. \\nSoon after, Netaji visited Andaman Islands as Head of the State of Provisional Government of Azad Hind from 29th -31st December 1943. Islanders gave him a warm welcome on his arrival. During his visit he stayed at the former British Chief Commissioner's official residence on Ross Island. Netaji hoisted the Tricolour for the first time on the Indian Soil on 30th December 1943, declaring the Islands as the first Indian Territory to be freed from the colonial rule. This was a unique act in the history of British Raj and the Indian freedom Movement. \\nOn the occasion of 75 years of First Flag on 30th December 2018, the Hon'ble Prime Minister of India Shri Narendra Modi ji hoisted the National Flag at Flag Point.  Now every year a function is organized at Flag Point commemorating the first flag hoisting by Netaji on 30th December function.",

    "description": "The Kandhuri Festival, which takes place at the Nagore Dargah in the Nagapattinam district, is a reflection of the union of faith, love, and unity. The 14-day Kandhuri Festival, also known as the Nagore Dargah Festival, is celebrated from the first to the fourteenth day of the saint Shahul Hamid's death anniversary during the Islamic month of Jamathul Aagir.Saint Hazrath Syed Shahul Hamid was the revered 13th-generation descendent of Saint Sufi. He achieved wider recognition for treating the physical illness of Thanjavur's 16th-century Hindu king Achuthappa Nayak. This historic significance allures the peculiar participation of Hindu devotees during the Kandhuri Festival.\\nThe significance of the 14-day festival is as follows:\\nDay 1 - The festival's opening day is commemorated by the hoisting of a sacred flag, which is then carried by chariots to the Nagore Dargah.\\nDay 2 to Day 7 - During these days of the festivals, holy saints read the Quran along with various prayers. The devotees flock to the Dargah to witness the Light of Allah which is displayed in the Dargah.\\nDay 8 -  The Kandhuri Festival's fireworks display is one of its many attractions. The fireworks have two purposes: first, to enhance the festive atmosphere, and second, to represent how truth drives away falsehood.\\nDay 9 -  On the ninth day of Jamaidul Akhir, the Fakirs visit the site of Hazarath Mohsin meditation site called the \"Peer Mandapam\". Also on this occasion, the devotees start a holy fast for the next 3 days. \\nDay 10 - A parade-like chariot ride carrying sandalwood paste is organised. The Rawla Shariff and the Great Saint's tomb will then be anointed with the auspicious paste as it is brought inside the premises.\\nDay 11 to day 14 - The fast that was initiated on the ninth day of the festival is ended by the devotees on the eleventh day. The Al Quran's message is recited throughout the 14 days, and its blessings are given to the Great Soul who had already attained the Creator Allah's presence. The flags and lights will be taken down after the conclusion of the Kandhuri Festival, leaving only the spiritual light of the Nagore Dargah to be cherished and adored. \\nThe spectacular Nagore Dargah celebration draws lakhs of worshippers from all across the country.",

    "description": "The unique Tuber Mela held at Joida in Uttara Kannada has been gaining popularity with every passing year. About 46 varieties of tubers were on display including those grown by the Kunbi community in Kali valley. Every year growers from Kerala, Tamilnadu, Maharashtra, Chamrajnagar and other places also participate in mela.  Surrounded by the thick forests of Joida taluk in Uttara Kannada district, the local women use their backyards to cultivate varieties of roots and tubers. These are largely grown to feed their families through the year. \\nThe tubers come in many shapes.  Some like the big taro grow to about 5-6 feet tall while others like the tania are cylindrical with bulbous centers. Yam and roots are integral to the survival of forest-dependent communities. However, there is little awareness outside about the diversity of tastes, colours and nutrition that tubers have to offer. \\nToday, these sweet potatoes and yams has attracted the attention of thousands of people across the nation  With the increase in the popularity of these tuber varieties, their market value has also gone up. To cater to this new demand, women have taken up cultivation in small patches of land - without affecting the forest ecosystem. For the women of Joida, the mela is not only an additional source of income but is a forum that encourages learning and discovery.  This festival has become an important part of identity of Joida people.",

Every year in the month of\\nJanuary, this Hindu Festival celebrates the birth of Murugan, lord of kurinji\\n(mountain) landscape also known as Lord Subramaniyam, the youngest son of Lord\\nShiva. \\n\\nArulmigu Dhandayuthapani Swamy Temple\\n\\nThis temple is\\nlocated in the hill town of Palani, in Dindigul district and is one among the\\n‘Arupadai Veedu’ (six abodes) of Lord Murugan in Tamil Nadu. The temple is\\nlocated on top of Sivagiri, the taller of Palani's two hills. The devotees\\naccess the temple using a main stairway carved into the hill side or the\\n'Yanai- Paadhai' (elephant's trail). The idol of the main deity was sculpted and\\nsanctified by Sage Bogar. According to the ancient Tamil Culture- Aaseevaham,\\nSage Bogar was one among the eighteen prominent siddhas. According to\\ntradition, the idol of the deity is composed of a mixture of nine poisonous\\nelements that, when combined in a specific ratio, provide a perpetual remedy.\\nThe statue, which stands on a stone pedestal with an archway enclosing it,\\ndepicts the deity Subramaniyam in the avatar he took at Palani: a youthful monk\\nstripped of all ornaments and hair, wearing only a loincloth.\\n\\nThaipoosam Thiruvizha at Arulmigu\\nDhandayuthapani Swamy Temple\\n\\nThaipusam is a\\nfestival of the Vel—a supernatural weapon of Lord Murugan used as the defending\\nand purifying power of Lord Murugan. On the day of the birth of Lord Murugan,\\nthe vel(an astra) was presented to him by his mother, Lord Parvati, to defeat\\nthe demons, Surapadhman, Singhamugan, and Tharakasuran, who symbolise hatred,\\narrogance, and evil. On this occasion, thousands of devotees fast for 41 days\\nand gather in this temple, chanting and raising slogans to the Almighty Lord\\nSubramaniyam. On the eve of Thaipoosam, devotees trek to the hill temple and\\nperform penance acts such as carrying ‘Kavadi’. The kavadi is made up of a\\nwooden arch carrying two pots of milk at either end, and it is decorated by\\nsmearing sandalwood paste, flowers, and peacock feathers. Devotees believe that\\nLord Muruga bestows his blessings on his worshippers to lessen the burden of\\nnegative karma from one’s life. Thousands of pilgrims throughout India visit\\nthis ‘Thaipoosam Thiruvizha’ to witness; the glorious deity, hundreds of\\ncolourful kavadis and to take a holy dip in Shanmuganadhi River.  The district administration along with the\\ndepartment of hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments oversee the arrangements\\nmade for this festival for processing smooth darshan for the pilgrims.\\nRecently, the district administration implemented special ramps and wheelchair\\nfacilities for pilgrims with disabilities.\\n\\n            Countless colourful kavadis, the\\nmagnificent deity, and the opportunity to take a holy bath in the Shanmuganadhi\\nRiver attract thousands of pilgrims from all across India to celebrate Arulmigu\\nDhandayuthapani Swamy Temple's \"Thaipoosam Thiruvizha”.",

    "description": "Mahadev Mela is organised every year on the ocassion of maha Shivratri. People from far away places come to Chauragarh, Pachmarhi to worship Mahadev. It is a saying that before going to Mahaev, it is necessary to cross Bhoora Bhagat(Chhindwara). There is a story behind Bhoora Bhagat. It is said that since childhood, Bhoora was absorbed in the worship of Lord. Once during the hymn, he got into ‘Samadhi’. Twenty-four hours later, his process of meditation was broken. After that he renounced the house and got absorbed in the worship of the Lord. According to the legends, during the sadhana in Chauragarh hills, he saw Mahadev.\\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\\n                            From Mahadev, he asked for boon that I should stay in your own legs and can guide the persons who come here. The legs  are present in the form of a rock in the monastery. The statue of Saint Bhoora Bhagat is situated in such a place which looks like  to seeing   gatekeeper sitting at at the gate of Lord Bholenath.  Gulal, Vermilion, Kapoor, Kharak, Supari and big Trishools are offerd here.",

    "description": "Wadda Ghallughara refers to the 'Great Massacre or Holocaust or Sikh Genocide' of Sikhs in 1762 by muslim forces who were unable to stop or convert Sikhs to Islam. Ahmad Shah Durrani, also known as Ahmad Shah Abdali, attacked India in January 1761. The third battle of Panipat took place between his forces and Marathas in which both sides suffered heavy losses, but Ahmad Shah Durrani emerged victorious. He looted and destroyed Delhi. When Ahmad Shah Durrani started his journey to go back to Afghanistan, Sikhs attacked his forces, right from River Sutlej to the River Indus and liberated about 2000 women prisoners. Sikhs also took away a major part of the looted wealth. Ahmad Shah Durrani decided to come back with a large force and destroy the Sikhs from the face of the earth. Ahmad Shah sent a force of about 12000 to crush Sikhs in August, 1761, but Sikhs defeated that force. In October, 1761 Sikhs defeated Obaid Khan, the Governor of Lahore and occupied Lahore. To take revenge, Ahmad Shah Durrani came back with a much larger force on 3 February 1762. The Sikhs immediately vacated Lahore and decided to escort their families to the Lakhi Jungle of the Malwa region. About 40000-60000 Sikh men, women and children started moving towards Malwa region and crossed River Sutlej. Ahmad Shah Durrani moved with a lightning speed. He asked Zain Khan, the Fauzdar of Sirhind and Bhikhan Khan, the Chief of Malerkotla to encircle Sikhs from the eastern side. Gurdwara Sri Wadda Ghallughara Sahib Rohira On 5 February 1762 Ahmad Shah with his forces crossed River Sutlej and attacked the slow moving Sikhs from the western side with 30000 horsemen. The forces of Sirhind and Malerkotla attacked from the other side with over 20000 men and artillery. At that time Sikhs had reached the site of Gurdwara Sri Wadda Ghallughara Sahib Rohira near the villages of Rohira and Kup. This was the site where the Wadda Ghallughara began. The Sikhs formed a protective ring, around 4 km in length long, to surround and protect their families. The Sikhs continued to fight and move towards Malwa region. The muslim led Sikh Genocide and fighting continued for the whole day. Near Gurdwara Sri Wadda Ghallughara Sahib Rohira is a huge government built memorial to the Wadda Ghallughara. However, we would urge you to visit the Gurdwara Sahib first and foremost.",

    "description": "Lord Venkateswara also termed Lord Balaji has been considered the savior of mankind in the troubled era of Kalyug. The idol of Balaji in Chimur is strikingly similar to the idol in the famous Tirupati Balaji temple. This temple is famous for the ‘Ghodayatra’ which begins as per the Hindu calendar on Magh Shuddha Trayodashi. During the ‘Ghodayatra’ the idol is paraded through town in a colorful procession which is attended by devotees in large numbers. The importance of Chimur lies in the antique temple of Balaji which has a great reputation, and the Ghoda ceremony which is held two days prior to the annual fair. It is said that the image of Lord Vishnu or Balaji was discovered by  a Kunbi person while digging the plinth of the shed for his cattle. He constructed a small temple to keep the idol and appointed a priest for its worship. The Ghoda Yatra has completed 248 years of its tradition.",

The dates vary every year in accordance with Guru Padmasambhava’s birthday. It is believed that seven oracles inhabit Ladakh, two of which manifest themselves through chosen ones in Stok each year. The chosen oracles undergo a severe month-long retreat where they are prohibited from eating meat. On the day of the festival, the oracles go into a trance and dance along the rooftops of the monastery in flowing white costumes. The villagers bow their heads in prayer, offer Chang (locally brewed rice beer) and Tsampa (roasted barley flour), and await the predictions for the year ahead. This is not like most festivals in India, photography is restricted and it is a rare privilege to witness this ancient tradition and learn of the rise of Buddhism through the vanquishing of demons in the Ladakh valley.",

The festival sees the installation of a beautiful idol of Kamanna or Kamadeva, also known as Manmatha, at the Ramalingeshwara Temple. According to legend, Kamanna was the son of Vishnu and was tasked with disturbing Lord Shiva’s meditation by Indra and other Gods. The reason for this was, that they wanted to get the demon Tarakasura killed, and this would be only possible by Shiva’s son who was not yet born.\\n\\nThe popular legend has it that Shiva opened his third eye and Kamadeva or Kamanna was reduced to ashes. This is also one of the legends associated with the celebration of Holi. In the Ramalingeshwara  temple of Navalgund, the idol Kamanna is installed and worshipped during Holi. Devotees offer silver articles to the idol  of Kamanna and believe that their wishes would be granted. If they are praying for a child they offer a silver cradle, and so on. The idol of Kamanna is installed and worshipped for a period of 5 days. People from far and wide irrespective of their faith throng the Ramalingeshwara temple to pray and worship the idol of Kamanna during the Holi festival.\\nNavalgund is located at a distance of about 40 kilometres from the city of Hubballi in Dharwad district of Karnataka.",

    "description": "The Attukal Pongala held in Attukal Temple, Thiruvananthapuram is the largest congregation of women for a festival in the world. Pongala, which means 'to boil over’, is the ritual in which women prepare sweet payasam (a pudding made from rice, jaggery, coconut and plantains cooked together) and offer it to the Goddess or ‘Bhagavathy’. The ritual can only be performed by women and the streets of the city are known to be jam-packed with faithful devotees during the time of the festival. The Goddess-fondly referred to as ‘Attukalamma’ is said to be appeased by this ritual. The entire Thiruvananthapuram city lights up in festive fervour and the number of devotees has increased to the point that it has been recorded in the Guinness World Book of Records. It is an experience that is extremely unique and must be soaked in first-hand to understand its magnificence.",

    "description": "If you are looking at a religious and spiritual event that will sweep you off your feet with its grandeur, then you must experience the vibes of the Vairamudi Utsava in Melukote, Karnataka.\\n\\nThe Vairamudi Utsava is an annual festival that takes place in the Melukote town of the Mandya district in Karnataka. Melukote is a historical town and is the place where the renowned Vaishnava saint, Shri Ramanujacharya is believed to have stayed for 12 years in the early part of the 12th century.\\n\\nThe centre of the Vairamudi Utsava is the sacred Cheluvanarayana Swamy temple of Melukote. The temple is dedicated to Cheluvanarayana Swamy, also known as Thirunarayana, a form of Lord Vishnu. Legend has it that the idol of Cheluvanarayana Swamy was worshipped in the Treta Yuga by Lord Rama himself and hence is also referred to as Ramapriya. Later in the Dwapara Yuga, the idol is believed to have been worshipped by Lord Krishna.\\n\\nThe Vairamudi Utsava also referred to as the Vairamudi Brahmotsava is an annual celebration that spans 13 days and happens during the months of March-April, the dates depend on the position of the stars according to the Hindu calendar.\\n\\nThe highlight of the festival is the Vairamudi crown festival and the Vairamudi procession. The Vairamudi is a crown embedded with diamonds and other precious stones. This crown along with two other crowns and jewels is kept in the Mandya District treasury and brought to Melukote annually for the ceremonies of the Vairamudi Utsava.\\n\\nThe Vairamudi is also known as Vajramukuta and according to legend was brought to the temple by Garuda, the vehicle of Lord Vishnu. The legend goes that once Lord Vishnu was asleep and his crown was stolen by a demon named Virochana. Garuda chased the demon and after a fierce fight, took possession of the sacred crown and brought it back to Lord Vishnu. Since that day the Vairamudi Utsava is celebrated.\\n\\nHistorically there is no evidence to trace the origin of this crown. However, there are two other crowns that have been donated by the erstwhile kings of Mysore, Maharajah Raja Wodeyar I, and Krishnaraja Wodeyar III. These are known as Rajamudi and Krishnarajamudi respectively. Out of the three, the Vairamudi is the most precious and adorns the head of the main deity during the Vairamudi Utsava.\\n\\nThe head priest of the Cheluvanarayana Swamy temple places the Vairamudi on the head of the main idol, with blindfolded eyes, as he is not supposed to look at the glittering crown.\\n\\nThe grand Vairamudi procession happens at night as it is believed that the sacred crown should not be exposed to sunlight. The grand spectacle of the dazzling Vairamudi can be seen from 9.00 PM to 3.00 AM.",

    "description": "Holi is known as the festival of colours. It is one of the most important festivals in India. Holi is celebrated each year with zeal and enthusiasm in the month of March by followers of the Hindu religion. Those who celebrate this festival, wait for it every year eagerly to play with colours and have delectable dishes.\\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\\n                            Holi is about celebrating happiness with friends and family. People forget their troubles and indulge in this festival to celebrate brotherhood. In other words, we forget our enmities and get into the festival spirit. Holi is called the festival of colours because people play with colours and apply them to each other’s faces to get coloured in the essence of the festival.\\nHistory of Holi\\nThe Hindu religion believes there was a devil king named Hiranyakashyap long ago. He had a son named Prahlad and a sister called Holika. It is believed that the devil king had blessings of Lord Brahma. This blessing meant no man, animal or weapon could kill him. This blessing turned into a curse for him as he became very arrogant. He ordered his kingdom to worship him instead of God, not sparing his own son.\\nFollowing this, all the people began worshipping him except for his son, Prahlad. Prahlad refused to worship his father instead of God as he was a true believer of Lord Vishnu. Upon seeing his disobedience, the devil king planned with his sister to kill Prahlad. He made her sit in the fire with his son on the lap, where Holika got burned and Prahlad came out safe. This indicated he was protected by his Lord because of his devotion. Thus, people started celebrating Holi as the victory of good over evil.",

While he was a court musician, Allauddin Khan totally reshaped Indian classical music's Maihar gharana. Though the Maihar gharana came into existence in the 19th Century, Khan's contribution to this genre of music was so rudimentary that he is frequently taken to be its creator.\\nThis was an era of speedy alteration for Hindustani instrumental music and Allauddin Khan deserves a special mention as he infused the dhrupad, bass sarod and beenbaaj into the playing of several classical instruments. He also put together an orchestra which played Indian instruments called the Maihar String Band.\\nSo, it is but natural that such a maestro be honored by way of an event bearing his name to keep his legacy alive. The performances by stalwarts of Indian classical music at Maihar Allauddin Khan Sangeet Samaroh keeps the audience tied to their seats under a mesmerizing spell.",

    "description": "Car\\nFestival, Arulmigu Narasimha Swamy Temple , Namakkal \\n\\nThe Arulmigu Narasimha Swamy Temple is located in\\nthe district of Namakkal, Tamil Nadu. Every year, during the Tamil month of\\nPanguni(March and April), the main deity of the temple, Lord Narasimha, is\\ntaken in procession around the temple. The temple was built in the eighth\\ncentury in the Dravidian architectural style. The rock cut architecture of the\\ntemple with pillared halls provides access to the sanctum (Garpagraha). The\\nsanctum sanctorum has a dark backdrop and is carved out of rock with three\\nsculptured cells, two pillars, and a verandah. The Asana murthi, or seated idol\\nof Lord Narasimha, is kept in the main sanctum for darshan. Two more sanctums\\nare located within the temple premises. In these sanctuaries, Namagiri Thayar\\nand Sri Lakshmi Narayana are worshipped. A separate temple is constructed for\\nthe goddess Namagiri Lakshmi, also known as Namagiri Thayar.\\n\\nHistory\\nand significance\\n\\nAccording to Treta Yuga (the second of the four\\nyugas), during the period of the Ramayana, Lord Hanuman brought the Saligramam,\\nin which Lord Narasimha vanished after defeating Hiranyakashipu. The devoted\\ndisciple of Sri Rama placed the Saligrama in the palm of Goddess Mahalakshmi\\nand then began to offer his daily prayers to Lord Narasimha. Later, Lord\\nHanuman discovered that the Saligrama went missing from Mahalakshmi's\\nhands.  The goddess told him that, as it\\nwas too heavy for her to bear, she cast it into the ground, where it eventually\\nturned into the Saligrama mountain. Lord Hanuman was mesmerised by a sparkling\\nlight radiating from the mountain and learned that it was none other than Lord\\nMaha Vishnu giving the goddess and Hanuman darshan in his Narasimha avatar.\\nLord Narasimha Swamy instructed Hanuman to stay and face the Saligrama hill\\nwhile bestowing his blessings on people in a towering, royal standing position\\nwithout a roof as he brought the Saligrama and helped build this sacred place\\n(gopuram). Lord Narasimha Swamy identified the location as \"Nama\\nGiri\" and referred to the goddess as \"Namagiri Thayar\" because goddess\\nMaha Lakshmi performed penance in this location by reciting \"Om Namo\\nNarayana,\" and the sacred hill was created after she placed the Saligrama\\non the ground. Traditionally, the devotees pay a visit to the \"Namagiri\\nThayar Sannidhi\" before entering the Arulmigu Narasimha Swamy Sannidhi.\\nThe principal deity, Lord Narasimha, is carried in procession to the sanctum of\\nLord Namagiri, his consort, each year during the “Thiru Veedhi Ula” (Car\\nfestival), which is observed in the month of Panguni, to shower blessings on\\nthe devotees jointly.",

Near this temple is Benne Halla, a waterbody believed to have miraculous medicinal properties.\\n\\nYamanur, a village 40 km from Hubballi on the highway to Sholapur, attracts people of many faiths. For Hindus, the deity here is Changdev Maharaj and for Muslims, it is Raja Bageswar. The object of worship is a 17th-century saint who rode a tiger, using a snake as the whip, and wielding scorpions as reins.\\n\\nAccording to legend, Changadev Maharaj undertook rigorous penance for hundreds of years and succeeded in defeating the god of death Yama. The name Yamanur is thus associated with Yama and translates as, “Yama’s Town.”. Devotees throng the temple-dargah from across  India, especially Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra as well as from nearby Gangavati, Hubballi-Dharwad and Gadag. The peak season for Muslim devotees is during the holy month of Ramzan. \\n\\nThere are two major rituals that devotees visiting the temple participate in. They take a holy dip in Benne Halla (also known as Yamanur Halla), about a mile from the temple. They, then proceed for Darshan at the temple. Horse-drawn carts transport the devotees between the temple and the stream. The 1 km stretch of Benne Halla has saline water, believed to have medicinal properties. The place is a great embodiment of faith and the secular fibre of Indian religion and culture.",

On the day of festivities a 20 to 25 feet long wooden pole is erected in the middle of the fairground and then two horizontal wooden planks measuring 4 to 5  feet are arranged in such a way  that a man is able to stand on it and on the top of the pillar a jar of jaggery Godh is hung.Young womens dance around the pillars in circular motion while singing songs and playing drums with the help of bamboo sticks Young men try to climb the pillar by leaping over the dancing group of girls. The young men who try to climb the pillar to take the jaggery get beaten up like 'donkeys' by  the women/girls  with sticks( dandiyas).  Some valiant men who are able to overcome the hurdles posed by the women wielding sticks and  are able to climb the pillar  are considered to be the winner and he even gets a chance to relish the jar of jaggery (potli ) tied on the top. The young man who gets behind in the race of  climbing is named as the 'donkey' who did not get  the jaggery.In some groups the youth hoist the flag Dhaja of his group on the pole in some tribal areas the flag is placed on the pole instead of the Jaggery.In the old days the  young man could marry his favorite bride from the crowd of girls if he wins the game The fair replicates  the ancient tradition of Swayamvara a tradition of marriage in which a woman chose a man as her husband from a group of suitors The young man has to bear with  the beatings like a donkey Gadheda to win the game so that he gets to eat jaggery Thus this fair is called Godh Gadheda Melo.",

    "description": "Ekadashis, in the Hindu calendar are a bimonthly occurrence. Simply put, they are the 11th day in the waxing and waning phase of the moon . These days are considered auspicious by Hindus. However, what makes Vaikuntha Ekadashi special is the belief that this is one day when the doors of heaven are thrown open to those devotees of Lord Vishnu who observe a fast.\\n\\nAs the legend goes, Lord Vishnu was fighting a battle with a demon – Muran. The long drawn battle made Lord Vishnu realize that he needed a new strategy or weapon to defeat his enemy. He took a break in a cave for a brief period, during which the demon attempted to attack him. A female power emerged out of him and killed Muran with a single glance. Pleased with this, Lord Vishnu granted a boon to this feminine power called Ekadashi – who in turn wished that the Lord throws open his Vaikunta dwar (door to heaven) open for any devotee who observes a fast on this very day. \\n\\nVaikuntha Ekadashi usually, falls in the months of December or January. On this day, the Vaishnavs follow a strict fast – with no intake of food especially rice. Hymns and bhajans are sung through the night.  It is believed that fasting on this one day is equal to fasting on all 24 Ekadashis. \\n\\nThough celebrated throughout India, Vaikuntha Ekadashi is most popular in South – specifically in the temples of Srirangam and Tirupati. Both the temples witness a huge inflow of pilgrims who throng the doors of Vishnu with the hope of attaining salvation as they are granted entry through the doors of heaven.",

    "description": "India is a land of festivals. There are a few festivals that fall on the same day but are celebrated under different names in different parts of the country. Makar Sankranti is one of them. It’s called Bihu in Assam, Baisakhi in Punjab, Uttarayan in Gujarat and Pongal in Tamil Nadu. The festival marks the end of winter and indicates the beginning of warmer days. It also indicates the movement of the Sun into Makar Raashi (zodiac of Capricorn) and tribute is paid to Surya (Sun god)\\n\\nSankranti is characterized by kites in most parts of the country. In Hyderabad, Telangana International Kite Festival is celebrated every year from the 13th to the 15th of January. The festival sees kite fliers from across the globe visit and showcase their fancy kites and kite flying skills. The skies are decked up with kites of different shapes and sizes. From animals to cartoon characters, one can see various types of kites. It’s a wonderful event that draws scores of people from all over the state.\\n\\nThe kite festival is not only limited to kites. There are various cultural programs organized for entertainment. Stalls are set up showcasing a variety of handicrafts, and handlooms from Telangana. There’s also an International Sweet festival that was also organized last year alongside the kite festival. The festival saw home cooks from various parts of the city prepare sweets from the states they belong to. It not only empowered many women to follow their entrepreneurial passion, but it also took the visitors on a gastronomical journey.",

The ground of the sacred Bagnath Temple in Bageshwar, on the banks of River Saryu, becomes the venue for the fair which goes on for about a week. During this timeframe, it is said the sun moves from the Southern to the Northern Hemisphere and it is reckoned auspicious to take a dip in the confluence of the rivers Saryu and Gomti. \\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\\n                            \\nThe fair's foundation was laid during the reign of the Chand dynasty kings.\\nThe festival depicts the rich culture and heritage of Kumaon and one can enjoy impressive performances by folk artists as they sing Jhoras, Chancharis, and Bairas during the celebration. Cultural groups and artists from other districts also showcase their performances. A variety of local produce such as iron and copper vessels, baskets, casks, bamboo articles, mats, mattresses, carpets, blankets, herbs, and spices can be purchased at the fair. \\nThe Uttarayani Fair also played a major role during India’s freedom struggle. It witnessed several political and social revolutions. Activists, including Pandit Badri Dutt Pandey (also popularly known as 'Kumaon Kesari'), revolted for the elimination of Coolie Beggar (Bonded Labour) in 1921, and tore Government registers at Saryu Bagad on Makar Sankranti.",

    "description": "One of the most important festivals of Andhra Pradesh is Makar Sankranti. It’s called Bihu in Assam, Baisakhi in Punjab, Uttarayan in Gujarat and Pongal in Tamil Nadu. The festival marks the end of winter and indicates the beginning of warmer days. It also indicates the movement of the Sun into Makar Raashi (zodiac of Capricorn) and tribute is paid to Surya (Sun god).It is a 4-day long festival starting on January 13 and ending on January 16. The day before Makar Sankranti is known as Bhogi. On this day, people burn old and discarded items outside their homes. This practice signifies the arrival of new energies and prosperity in life. People visit their friends and relatives and exchange sweets. Arisalu - made from rice flour and sesame seeds - is one of the most loved sweets during the festival.\\n\\nOn the day of Sankranti, kites are flown by people from all walks of life. It’s a tradition that is followed not only in Andhra Pradesh but across India as well. People play music and soak in the festivities. \\nOn the two days that follow, Kanuma and Mukkanuma, people feed animals, particularly cows, in the spirit of charity. Mukkanuma is especially significant for farmers, who offer gifts to their cattle and pray to the elements, such as soil and water, for a good harvest.",

The Mughal emperor was known for his Muslim orthodox views and when approached for help with the temple renovation he categorically refused. A few days later his dear sister Jahanara fell very sick and despite treatment by the best doctors was not getting any better. She saw the Mother Goddess in her dreams and was asked to tell her brother to help with the renovation, after which she would recover from her illness completely. As soon as Jahanara shared this dream with her brother, he directed workers to renovate the Goddess's temple.\\nThe fair is also famous for shops selling animals. especially horses and people would visit the fair for buying and selling of animals and goods from UP, Delhi and other places.\\nSet-up of circus shows, games and shops selling local goods is also a part of this annual fair*  The exact dates of the festival depend upon the Hindu Calendar.",

    "description": "The World celebrates the new year on January 1. But for one of the world’s most diverse countries, one new year isn’t enough. India is home to people from different religions and faiths, some even following their own calendars. Bihu, Baishakhi, Gudi Padwa, and Ugadi are just a few of the new years that we celebrate in India.\\n\\nIn Karnataka, the auspicious festival of Ugadi, which represents the beginning of the New Year, is celebrated with great sheer delight and zeal on the first day of Chaitra. The universe was presumably formed on this day, according to Hindu mythology, by Lord Brahma. The festival therefore has a truly meaningful significance in the region because it marks the start of nature's annual cycle and the arrival of the spring season.\\n\\nIf you want to experience the full splendour of the Ugadi festival, you should make the journey to Karnataka's small towns and villages, where the festivities are glorious and represent the true essence of the region. Ugadi, like any other festival in India, is celebrated with delicious food. And to commemorate the occasion, mouth-watering special delicacies are prepared throughout the state. Thus, Ugádi, a joyous festival, symbolises peace, harmony, and prosperity.",

Khandoba or Malhari Martanda is the deity of several Maharastrian families, including warriors and priests, as well as farmers and herders. The temple is located on a 758-m-high hillock, which is rich in lime deposits that are the primary building material for the noted Shaniwar Wada Fort, the central seat of the Maratha empire.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe Bhandara festival held here sees close to six lakh visitors flocking to the temple town. It involves the showering of haldi (turmeric) as the devotees make their way up the hill. The route, in fact, gets a pretty yellow hue because of this tradition. The “sonyachi Jejuri” or golden Jejuri takes places three times in a year. An idol of the deity is taken on a yatra (journey) till the nearby Karha river, where it is immersed.\\n\\n \\n\\nTo reach the temple, you have to go through seven arches and then go down some steps. It has a generous courtyard with walled compounds. There are 63 verandahs (roofed porches) in the complex. It is designed like a fort with three entrance gates and this is why the locals call it 'kot', which means fort. All devotees have to enter from the northern gate.",

In some form or the other, it is celebrated all over Rajasthan. “Gan” is a synonym for Lord Shiva & “Gauri” or “Gaur” stands for Goddess Parvati, the heavenly consort of Lord Shiva. Gangaur celebrates the union of the two and is a symbol of conjugal & marital happiness. Gangaur is celebrated in the month of Chaitra (March-April), the first month of the Hindu calendar. This month marks the end of winter & the onset of spring. This festival is celebrated especially by women, who worship clay idols of “Gan” & “Gauri” in their houses. These idols are worshipped by unmarried girls who seek the blessings of Gan & Gauri for a good husband, while the married women pray for the good health and long life of their husbands. This worship which starts from the first day of the chaitra month culminates on the 18th day into Gangaur festival with a great religious fervor. On the eve of Gangaur festival, women decorate their palms and fingers with henna. The idols of Gan and Gauri are immersed in a pond or in a nearby lake on the last day of the festival. A traditional procession of Gangaur commences form the Zanani-Deodhi of the City Palace, passing through Tripolia Bazaar, Chhoti Chaupar, Gangauri Bazaar, Chaugan stadium and finally converges near the Talkatora. The procession is headed by a colorful pageantry of old palanquins, chariots, bullock carts and performing folk artists.",

On March 26, 2022, the Inclusive Photowalk was organised in collaboration with the Madras Photo Bloggers Team in North Chennai's Flower Bazaar area. The Flower Bazaar, also known as \"Poo Kadai Theru,\" is a well-known flower market in Parry's Corner that has expanded into a huge flower market that distributes flowers all across the city. This bazaar, referred to as Chennai's oldest flower market, receives daily deliveries of delicate roses, long-stemmed tulips, fragrant jasmine, rare orchids, exotic magnolias, and other vibrant and magnificent flowers from all across the state. Heritage sites including Pachaiyappa's Higher Secondary School, Ambedkar College of Law, and others were explored during the walk. After the gratifying response received on the Inclusive Photowalk, the Tamil Nadu Tourism Development Corporation conducted the second phase of the Inclusive Photowalk under the theme of “Community Dwellings of Triplicane” in Chennai on July 17th, 2022. This time the photographers explored the treasures of Triplicane, including the places of Bommai Chathram, Peyazhwar Street, Parthasarathy Temple, Andal mandapam, and South Madha Street. The photographers were given an opportunity to capture the visual imagery of vibrant history. Communicating with each other was made easier for deaf photographers as the team involved sign language interpreters. The Photo-walk tours are organised with the motive of showcasing the vibrant culture of Chennai, viz., crowded markets, small lanes, interesting history, and breathtaking photos, culminating in an engaging anecdote. The drone photographers, in particular, had a fantastic time delving into different perspectives of Chennai!",

Rukmani was deeply in love with Krishna and was determined\\nto marry him. But her brother loaded with disgust towards Krishna, forced her\\nto get married to Shishupal. Rukmani opposed but when her father too agreed and\\nsupported her brother’s decision, she wrote a letter to Krishna to save her from the\\nsituation and declared a fast up to death if he didn’t come. That letter is\\nreferred as first love letter in the history of Love.\\n\\nOn the day of her marriage with Shishupal in the presence of\\nhundreds of kings, Krishna with help of his brother Balram takes  Rukmani from Vidarba and marries . devi\\nRukmani at Madhavpur on the seashore near Dwarika, close to Porbandar (in\\ntoday’s time).

    "description": "Ladakh offers stunning scenery no matter which season you visit. But this time of the year, parts of the region come alive as apricot trees blossom with soft pink flowers. You can catch the mesmerising season before it’s gone with the Apricot Blossom Ladakh festival this April. Organised by Ladakh Tourism, the festival lasts from 04-17 April and promises cultural programmes and exhibitions featuring local handicrafts. Along with the breathtaking views of apricot blossoms, you can even get your hands on local apricot products like jams, juices and syrups. Ladakh is home to some of the sweetest apricots in the world—a variety known as Raktsey Karpo. In Turtuk and several other parts of Ladakh, almost every house has apricot trees in their yard and residents harvest the sweet fruit to eat as is, sun-dry or turn into jams or simple desserts. Locally known as chuli, the apricots have been consumed by Ladakhis for decades, and it was only in 2013 that researchers discovered that the Rakstey Karpo varietal is unique only to Ladakh. Now, the region is celebrating its fruit with the Apricot Blossom Ladakh festival. In Leh, you can enjoy the festival in Lhardo (04 April), Saspol(05 April), Udmaroo (10 April), Sumoor (11 April) and Takmachik(13 April).",

Apricot, Known as “Chuli/ Halmann” in Ladakhi, was introduced to the arid region of Ladakh over century ago by Chinese traders passing through the area via Silk Route. Now, in the 21st century, the fruit has become an integral part of Ladakh’s culture, heritage and economy. The uniquely tolerant and highly stable plant of apricot has embraced the sandy soil of the cold desert and makes it one of the largest producers of apricot in India. The apricot flower bloom signifies the onset of summer after the long and harsh winter of Ladakh. In Ladakh, apricots are usually served as desserts, particularly during traditional festivals. According to a research paper published by the Korean Society for Horticultural Science, Ladakh apricots can be classified into two categories based on kernel taste – fruits with a bitter kernel are called Khante while those with a sweet kernel are called Ngarmo. During this period, settlements in the western belt of Ladakh are covered with a white sheet of flowers.Viewing of Apricot Blossoms, Cultural Programme, display of Apricot and other local products, Handloom and Handicraft products, farming activities and food exhibition are the main attractions of this festival to promote Tourism in this region.",

It lavishly showcases Karnataka's religious traditions and rich culture. This spectacular celebration is held at Bangalore's famed Dharmaraya Swamy Temple. According to the Hindu calendar, it is observed every year in the Chaitra month (March/April). But besides its affinity with the Thigala community, the magnificent celebration of the festival draws spectators from all around the city. While various ceremonies are held throughout these days, the great procession is the festival's pinnacle.\\n\\nThe name 'Karaga' corresponds to an earthen pot that holds a flowery pyramid and the idol of the Goddess. The Karaga is placed on the bearer's head without being touched. The bearer is dressed like a woman, with bracelets, a mangal-sutra, and vermillion on his forehead. The Karaga festival may be traced back to the epic Mahabharata. It depicts Draupadi as the quintessential woman and honours her as the Goddess Shakti.",

    "description": "Vaisakhi, also pronounced Baisakhi as well as Basoa (among Dogras), marks the first day of the month of Vaisakhi and is traditionally celebrated annually on 13th April and sometimes on 14th  April. It is seen as a celebration of spring harvest primarily in Northern India. Further, other Indian cultures and diaspora celebrate this festival too. Whilst it is culturally significant as a festival of harvest, in many parts of India, Vaisakhi is also the date for the Indian Solar New Year. Some 5297 years ago, on this day Raja Shaktikaran Dogra, also known as Raja Shastri, started the Shastri Calendar alias Dogra-Pahari Calendar on this day, so this day has special historical relationship with the Dogras. For Sikhs, in addition to its significance as the harvest festival, during which Sikhs hold kirtans, visit local Gurdwaras, community fairs, hold nagar kirtan processions, raise the Nishan Sahib flag, and gather to socialize and share festive foods. This year the Festival includes performances depicting local folk dances through J&K Academy of Art, Culture & Languages; food stalls of Dogra cuisines; departmental stalls of Handicraft, Handloom, Industries & Commerce, JKTDC and Agriculture Department etc. Besides, the Directorate of Tourism, Jammu in association with District Administration Jammu, JKAACL and Mubarak Mandi Heritage Society is organizing Baisakhi Festival 2023  across Jammu City at multiple venues viz: Events on 13th April 2023 •\tCultural Carnival/ Shobha Yatra from Maharaja Hari Singh Park. •\tCultural procession with Chariot fun rides enroute old Jammu city. •\tCultural performances Lakhdata Bazaar (Nukkad and dhol beating/ Indira chowk) •\tCultural Bonanza and felicitation of Dogra Icons at Mubarak Mandi and Maharaja Hari Singh Park.

    "description": "What makes Baisakhi so special, is that it marks the first day of the new year according to the Sikh calendar. Another amazing root to this festival is that Baisakhi was one of the three main festivals that the third Sikh Guru, Guru Amar Das ji chose to celebrate. On the day of Baisakhi, in the year 1699, the tenth Sikh Guru, Sri Guru Gobind Singh Ji established the Khalsa Panth.Baisakhi is also the time when farmers begin harvesting of the Rabi crops. It is a significant event for the farmers in the region and observed as a thanksgiving to the Gods and the natural elements. Waking up to the beautiful Baisakhi day morning is like stepping up on a fortune as one can see Punjab at its happiest and most joyful self-preparation for the festival. It begins well in advance and Gurudwaras are decorated, men prepare and practice for their Martial Arts. In this period of celebrations, artisans from across the State and country come to sell their Handicrafts all over Punjab. The purpose of Baisakhi celebrations is to come together with the feeling of oneness and joy. On this day men, women and children dress up in their favorite traditional attire. Punjabis been outstanding hosts, one can book a Farm stay or a Homestay and celebrate it with the locals. Punjab tourism offers various options which can be chosen for a perfect stay. If you happen to be in Amritsar, you can have Kada Prasad and Guru ka Langar at the Golden Temple. Spectate the Nagar Kirtan and the prowess of the Lions of Punjab. Make sure to dance to the beat of Bhangra and Gidda with the locals too.",

The pillar now serves as the temple's main deity. The main deity is present along with an idol of Lord Hanuman who is the presiding deity of this temple. Since the temple does not possess a full sculpted idol of Lord Vishnu, celebrations like Vaikuntha Ekadasi and Sorga Vaasal Thirappu are not conducted in this temple. This distinguishes this temple from other Vaishnavite temples in the state, where these occasions are lavishly commemorated. The Dasavadhara Mandapam, a pillared hall inside the temple, is well-known for its 10 beautifully sculpted Lord Vishnu incarnations. \\nOn the festival day, the abhishegam (holy bath), which consists of nine different ingredients: water, ghee, sandalwood paste, honey, turmeric, milk, curd, honey, and panchamirtham (an amalgam of fruit and jaggery) is performed to the \"Utsava Moorthy\" (procession deity). The enormous chariot is draped in colourful silk robes and fragrant flowers, and the Utsava Moorthy is placed on top of it while it is pulled in a procession by thousands of worshippers who worship the deity in chant and songs.",

    "description": "Chitra Pournami\\nFestival at MangalaDevi Kannagi Temple, Theni District\\nThe Mangala Devi Kannagi Temple is a well-known religious site located in\\nthe beautiful splendour between Theni District, Tamil Nadu and Idukki District,\\nKerala. The temple is placed in a hill top region through the panoramic view of\\nWestern Ghats. The devotees trek a steep but walkable hill road of Cumbum\\nvalley. Around 2000 years ago, Cheran Chenguttuvan, the ruler of the ancient\\nTamilagam, constructed the temple for Kannagi in Vannathiparai, located at a\\ndistance of 7 kms from Pazhayankudi, Theni district. He named the temple\\n\"Kannagi Kottam or Mangaladevi Kannagi Temple '' and performed auspicious\\npoojas there. \\n\\nHistory \\n\\n The main deity\\nin this temple is Kannagi, a historically calm yet fearless Tamil queen who\\nserves as the protagonist in the epic poem ‘Silapathikaram’ written by Illango\\nAdigal. The goddess Kannagi (Kannaki Amman) is adored and praised as a model of\\nchastity. She is admired for her unquestioning commitment to her spouse despite\\nhis unfaithful actions. Even now, Kannaki continues to act as a symbol of the\\nmoral courage found in a common woman who can challenge the monarchy for\\njustice.\\n\\n It was alleged\\nthat, the Ceylon royal Gajabahu, was one among some of the prominent guests who\\nattended the 'Mangala Devi's' idol installation ceremony. The temple complex is\\nmade up of four stone buildings that contain other idols in addition to\\nMangaladevi. The stone walls have sculptures and the ure of Silapathikaram\\nengraved into them.\\n\\n Chitra\\nPournami Festival     \\n\\n Chitra Pournami,\\nis observed as a full moon day, which falls in the Tamil month of Chithirai in\\nbetween April and May according to the Lunar cycle. \\n\\nThe temple is open to\\nthe devotees only once a year, during the Chitra Pournami Festival. The Chitra\\nPournami celebrations (full moon day) are held during the months of April and\\nMay, in which priests from Tamil Nadu and Kerala perform rituals and prayers at\\nthe temple. The ceremony is believed to bless women with long happy marriages\\n(sumangali) .\\n\\nMany women devotees\\ngather here on this occasion to cook and offer Pongal, a delicious sweet rice\\ndish, to the Goddess Mangala Devi. An panchaloha idol, made up of five metals\\nis brought from Kambam on the eve of this celebration. The district\\nadministration of Theni, Tamil Nadu and Idukki, Kerala supervise the\\npreparations for this celebration. Numerous precautions are taken to make sure\\nthat the ecosystem is not harmed by the increasing influx of worshippers to the\\ntemple.\\n\\n Every year,\\nduring the eve of Chitra Pournami, hundreds of women gather here to worship\\nGoddess Mangala Devi for glory in life and happiness.",

    "description": "Srirangam is a city near\\nTiruchirapalli (Trichy) known for its famous Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple. This\\nvast temple is believed to be the largest functional Hindu temple in the world,\\nspread over an area of 156 acres. The massive temple complex is made up of 48\\ndifferent temples. The chief deity of the temple is Lord Vishnu. The temple\\ncomplex is located on an island created by the Kaveri and the Coleroon rivers.Visiting the Srirangam\\ntemple anytime is an experience in itself, visiting during the Chithirai Car\\nFestival has a magic of its own. The Chithirai Car Festival is also known as\\nSrirangam Chithirai Ther and is an important annual event of the temple. The\\nfestival is spread over 11 days and occurs in the Chithiral month of the Tamil\\nCalendar.The origins of the\\nChithirai Car Festival are traced to the Vijayanagara dynasty. The idols of the\\ndeities, Sri Namperumal and his consorts Sri Sridevi, and Sri Bhoodevi, had\\nbeen brought back to Srirangam, after many decades. They had been in Madurai,\\nTirupati, and other places, under the protection of the Vijayanagara Kingdom.\\nSrirangam had been attacked and plundered by Muslim invaders, and the idols had\\nbeen taken away for safekeeping.That tradition of\\ncelebrating the car festival continues to this day and is also called Viruppan\\nThirunal in honour of Virupanna Udayar. On the first day of the festival, the\\ncontribution of Virupanna Udayar is mentioned. The festival is celebrated with\\ngreat devotional fervour and is a very important festival of the Vaishnavite\\ncommunity.The 11-day festival\\nstarts with the temple flag hoisting or Dhwajarrohanam on the first day. The\\nhighlight of the festival is the procession of the deity through the streets of\\nSrirangam mounted on a chariot decorated as different Vahanams (Vehicles).\\nThese Vahanas include Sesha Vahanam, Hanumantha Vahanam, Simha Vahanam, Yali\\nVahanam, and silver and gold horse Vahanam, among others.",

This is followed by the dance of the Sun God, an enactment of the creation-myth of the birth of Brahma and Ganesha. The other dances include the dance of the Bur Deva along with Gopi Chand (Krishna) and Radhika. After these initial performances, the focus now shifts to the enactment of the local Ramkatha. Episodes from Rama’s life, beginning with his visit to Janakpur and culminating with his coronation following his return from exile, are sung to a total of 324 beats and steps. There are 18 masks made of Bhojpatra that are worn by dancers who enact the Ramayana through the dance. It takes place in the courtyard of the Bhumiyal Devta's temple.\\nAnother important aspect of these performances is the singing of Jagar, a musical rendition of local legends.* The exact dates of the festival depend upon the Hindu Calendar.",

    "description": "Tataiahgunta Tirupati Gangamma Jatara Prominence Goddess, Gangamma is believed to have been born in Avilala, Tirupati. Tataiahgunta Tirupati Gangamma is worshipped as the younger sister of Lord Sri Venkateswara. The ‘jatara’ is ritualistically observed by native residents of Tirupati. Tirupati Gangamma Jatara is the important festival for Tirupati people. People from different places visit this Temple during the festival. Tirupati Gangamma Jatara is a annual festival which is observed in the first fortnight of May every year. As a birthday gift from a brother to his sister, The Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam sends “Parisu”, an auspicious gift on behalf of Lord Sri Venkateswara, which includes sarees, turmeric, kumkum, bangles etc., to Goddess Gangamma during the Jatara.  Gangamma temple in Tirupati is known as Tataiah gunta Gangamma. According to temple records, `Tataiahgunta’ was associated with a 16th Century devotee,`Tirumala Thathacharyulu’, who was said to have built a `Gunta’  (tank) and consecrated the temple near it. \"Tirupati Gangamma Jatara and It’s History\". According to folklore, Legend has it that the local chief called as “Palegadu” used to seduce beautiful women. As per his commands, newly-wed women were forced to spend their first wedding night with him. The women prayed to Goddess Jaganmatha who then took birth as Gangamma, at Avilala village, near Tirupati.  When she grew up, Palegadu cast his lustful eyes on Gangamma. Palegadu insulted Gangamma, by pulling her hand in full public view when the later rejected him. When she showed her frightening “Viswaroopam” to him, to escape death, Palegadu fled and hid himself in an unidentified location. In search of him, Gangamma wore several attires for three days. And on the fourth day, she lured the Palegadu, attired as his boss (dora). Mistaking her for his boss, Palegadu came into the public, only to be slain by her. To mark this memorable event and thanksgiving gesture to the Jaganmatha in the form of Goddess Gangamma, Jatara celebration is being held by Tirupati people.",

The game is started by the temple priest  by tossing the ball between them. Both groups try to take the ball to their side. The side that succeeds the maximum times in 3 rounds is declared as the winner.The rice gathered while taking the ball to each house, is then cooked & served as Prasad to all.*  The exact dates of the festival depend upon the Hindu Calendar.",

    "description": "Jallikattu Tamil Nadu celebrates a four day harvesting festival annually during\\nthe month of January, popularly known as “Pongal”. The celebration is held to\\npraise the Sun God for nourishing the crops throughout the year. The four day\\ncelebration involves; Bhogi, Surya Pongal, Mattu Pongal and Kaanum Pongal.  The third day of the festival is Mattu\\nPongal, which features a significant ancient sport known as Jallikattu - the\\nbull taming sport.About Jallikattu\\n\\n\\n\\nJallikattu has various names, including Manju Virattu, Sallikattu, and\\nYeru Thazhuvudhal.   In ancient times,\\n‘Yeru thazhuvuthal’ or embracing the bull, was connected in displaying the\\nmen’s pride and victory for winning over a girl for marriage. The sport has\\nprevailed in Tamil culture for over 2000 years now. \\n\\n \\n\\nManju Virattu is conducted every year in various regions of the state\\nincluding Madurai, Sivagangai and Pudukottai. The event begins as the bulls are\\nreleased to the arena via a small entrance known as “ Vaadi Vaasal”. The male\\nplayers known to be bull tamers, amid loud whistles, applauses and cheers wait\\nnearby to the entrance and try to grab the bull's hump, which needs a lot of\\ncourage and prudence. The person who clutches the hump and takes the pouch\\ncontaining cash or presents without falling off the bull is deemed the winner. \\n\\n\\n\\nBesides being identified as a conquering sport, it is also associated\\nwith the good motive of preserving pure-breeding of native bulls which were\\nbred exclusively for the purpose of mating. The native Kangayam, Pulikulam,\\nUmbalachery , Bargur and Malai Maadu are the combative breeds which compete\\nhighly in this sport. The sport has become the emotion of Tamilians with its\\nlong rooted historical and cultural significance.Madurai and Jallikattu\\n\\n\\n\\nThe festival of cattle-worship is much delighted in Madurai and its sub\\nregions. The sport is considered as a celebration in these areas. Preparations\\nfor this festival start months before the day of the event. The invites are\\nsent to various villages about the celebration where the bulls are registered\\nto enter the arena after a physical health check up. The district\\nadministration, Public works department, Police department along with local\\nevent organizers work together to maintain the integrity and dignity of the\\nsport.\\n\\n \\n\\nEvery year the regions of Avaniyapuram, Alanganallur and Palamedu\\nattract around 700 native breeds of bulls and about 300 bull tamers from all\\naround the state for this competition. The event also attracts a swarm of\\npeople, both locally and globally, visiting these areas to watch this\\nmagnificent sport. The bull taming sport in these regions are also telecasted\\non National Television every year. \\n\\nThe Hon’ble Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu has also announced plans to\\nconstruct an international sports arena in Madurai to organise ancient sports\\nof Tamil culture every year.",

    "description": "Often known as the harvesting festival, Pongal is one of the biggest festivals celebrated in India's Southern part. It is primarily celebrated in Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Puducherry.\\n\\nPongal comes from Tamil Literature, which means to boil or to overflow. It is a celebration to thank Sun God, Mother Earth and various other farm animals that helps farmers to contribute to a bountiful harvest.\\n\\nAccording to Hindu mythology, Lord Shiva instructed Basava (Bull) to visit the Earth and ask the Human to bathe and receive an oil massage every day. Nevertheless, Basava (Bull) declared that he would eat daily and take a bath once a month.\\n\\nAngry, Lord Shiva condemned the Bull (Basava) to dwell on Earth forever and told him that he must plough the fields to increase food production for mankind. Therefore, the mythology is followed to date, and people observe this festival with crops and cattle after harvesting.\\n\\nPongal goes way back in the Sangam age from 200BC to 300AD. During this era, Pongal was celebrated as Thai Niradal, and it also marks the beginning of the auspicious Tamil Month called Tai.\\n\\nAlso, in the olden days, the festival was marked by unmarried girls fasting and performing rituals,praying to God to save their agricultural prosperity of the country. They would not take any dairy products or oil their hair for one month. In fact, they would also bound themselves to take their ceremonial bath early in the morning only and prohibit the use of any harsh words. These festivities paved the way to today's Pongal.\\n\\nTo put it differently, one should not miss witnessing Pongal, the festival of new beginnings. It could be an unforgettable experience for travellers who enjoy discovering and learning about Southern India's culture. The festival observes on January 14 every year in the country. The dates are also shared by other festivals across India like Makarsankranti, Bihu, Lohri, International Kite festival, etc.",

    "description": "Foundation stone of Sri Harmandir Sahib, Amritsar, was laid down by the renowned Sufi Saint of Qadiry order, Mir Mohamed Khan, popularly known as Hazarat Mian Mir of Lahore. Sri Harimandir Sahib, unlike any other place of worship, was built at a lower level than the surrounding area. It has doors on all four sides, signifying both humanity and universalism and that it was open to people of all the denominations. Sri Harmandir Sahib was established for signing the praises of Almight — “Har Japae Har Mandir Sajia ||”\\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\\n Guru Arjan Dev, the fifth Sikh Guru, often visited Lahore, the birthplace of his father (the fourth Guru, Guru Ram Das) to meet his relatives. On the occasion of one of such visit, he called on Mian Mir. The two and became life-long friends. Mian Mir was thirteen years older than Guru Arjan.\\nGuru Arjan was responsible for the construction of many tanks and buildings. In 1588, he planned to build a Gurdwara in the centre of the holy tank called Amritsar or the pool of nectar. As the Gurdwara was to be open to people of all castes, creeds and climes, he invited Sia Mian Mir to lay the foundation stone of the Sri Harmandir Sahib. He came to the city of Amritsar wearing a religious mendicant’s long cloak made up of patches of coarse wool and a cone-shaped cap, with a rose flower on top.\\nMian Mir was given one of those warm welcomes for which Guru Arjan was famous. The two holy men embraced each other in sincere love and regard. The purpose of the Gurdwara was disclosed to the Sufi saint. Sia Mian Mir was delighted at the fine objectives the Guru had in mind. The foundation-stone was laid. Hymns were sung in praise of God and sweets were distributed among the audience.",

He built the cities of Taran Taran and Kartarpur also along with tanks for the people to bathe.\\nThe main task of the fifth was the compilation of Sri Guru Granth Sahib by collecting all the available hymns of his predecessors, including 2218 hymns of his own. He gave the Sikhs a central place of worship, the Golden Temple, and organized congregations for daily worship.\\nSeeing the growing popularity of the Guru both among Hindus and Muslims, the Mughal emperor Jehangir wanted to put an end to his life and finally got him executed on some pretext. So the Guru died a martyr at Lahore in May 1606; where a Gurdwara ‘Dera Sahib stands in his memory.\\nਰਮ ਪੁੰਜ ਸਿਰੋਮਣੀ ਸਿਦਕੀਆਂ ਦੇ,\\nਸਿਦਕ ਸੀਸ ਦੇ ਨਾਲ ਨਿਭਾਣ ਵਾਲੇ।\\nਦੁੱਖ ਸੁੱਖ ਦੇ ਵਿਚ ਅਡੋਲ, ਰਹਿਕੇ,\\nਸਿਦਕ ਸਬਰ ਦੇ ਪੂਰਨੇ ਪਾਣ ਵਾਲੇ।\\nਰਹਿਕੇ ਤਰਨ ਤਾਰਨ ਗੋਇੰਦਵਾਲ ਅੰਦਰ,\\nਗੀਤ ਮੋਹਿਨ ਪਿਆਰੇ ਦੇ ਗਾਣ ਵਾਲੇ।\\nਕਦੇ ਹਰੀ ਮੰਦਰ ਕਦੇ ਦੇਗ ਅੰਦਰ,\\nਕਦੇ ਲੋਹ ਤੇ ਚੌਂਕੜੀ ਲਾਣ ਵਾਲੇ।\\nਸਿਦਕ ਵਾਨ ਗੰਭੀਰ ਤੇ ਬ੍ਰਹਮ ਗਯਾਨੀ,\\nਪੁੰਜ ਸੱਚ ਦੇ ਸੱਚ ਧਿਆਣ ਵਾਲੇ।\\nਵਾਰੀ ਲੱਖ ਵਾਰੀ ਸੱਚੇ ਗੁਰੂ ਅਰਜਨ,",

It is an opportunity for travellers to see the workings of an Border Security Force (BSF) post on the border of India. Some of the activities and sights that will interest the traveller include the retreat ceremony against the backdrop of a glorious orange sunset where the Border Security Force (BSF) jawans put up a gallant show of marching with pride to end another day of guarding the borders. A weapon display and photo gallery at Nada Bet includes guns, tanks and other sophisticated devices that help in keeping the border and inland places secure.  \\nA special meditation session for the visitors coming to Nadabet is being organised on 1st June 2023 Meditation is something anyone can do, anytime, anywhere — even someplace loud. It’s easy to learn and involves some pretty basic techniques. Like anything new, the more we meditate, the more comfortable we’ll get spending time with our mind. Other times, we see a roadblock ahead and try to resist it, like we do when we think or feel something uncomfortable. Meditation trains us to notice the traffic without chasing or fighting it — just to let the thought come. Then gently shift our focus away from it and back onto our breath — to let the thought go. The more we practice, the more we can see thoughts for what they are: just thoughts. It’ll get easier to let them go and “get out of our heads” to be more engaged in what we’re doing, whether we’re spending time with family, making time for self-care, or working against a deadline.  This event will start at 10 o’clock in the morning till  12 o’clock .",

In each of the seven districts that make up the Bastar division, festivals are observed in the same way. Over 600 years have passed since the beginning of the Bastar Goncha Rath Yatra celebration. Because it is observed at the same time as the Hindu festival of Rath Yatra, the Goncha Festival is also frequently referred to as the Chariot Festival. It is amazing to see the ferocious and enthusiastic celebration of the Goncha Festival in Chhattisgarh. The Bastar tribal people who take part in this festival amazes with their zeal and tenacious attitude. According to the Hindu calendar, the Goncha Festival is observed during Rath Yatra. The Gregorian calendar indicates that it often occurs in the month of July. One can take part in the celebrations when they are  traveling to the state of Chhattisgarh during the Goncha Festival.",

    "description": "pRath Yatra or Jatra is the\\ncelebration of Lord Jagannath, Attracting thousands of devotees and visitors each\\nyear in Jharkhand, the Rath Yatra is held on Shukla Paksha Dwitiya tithi in the\\nmonth of Aashadha. This year it was celebrated on July 01, 2022. Jagannath\\nTemple in Ranchi is a 17th-century temple dedicated to Lord Jagannath. It was\\nbuilt by the king of Barkagarh, Jagannathpur Thakur Ani Nath Shahdeo, in 1691.\\nCompleted on December 25, 1691, it is located about 10 km from the main town.\\nThe temple is on top of a small hillock. According to mythological beliefs, on\\nthis day, Goddess Subhadra, the younger sister of Lord Jagannath. The Jagannath\\nRath Yatra has always adhered to the same rituals, which is what makes it so\\nholy. Nothing has been altered during this festival. Rath Yatra has\\nhistorically been observed annually in Jharkhand. Throughout this well-known\\nevent, Lord Jagannath and his siblings Devi Subhadra and Lord Balabhadra are\\nadored. According to the spiritual significance of Katha Upanishad- The\\nfestival talks about the Human body as Rath and sarathi or driver as God, who\\ndrives the chariot of the body to the yatra/journey to material existence or\\nBhavasagar. Classically it is mentioned as the soul drive within the Rath of\\nbody, which has been intellect and total devoted to God the driver of the\\nchariot towards the material existence. The wheels are the significance of\\nvelour. The famous Jagannath Rath Yatra of the capital Ranchi witnessed a huge\\ncrowd of devotees on Friday. Lakhs of devotees attended the Rath Yatra along\\nwith Governor Ramesh Bais and Chief Minister Hemant Soren and the entire\\ncapital reverberated with the hail of Lord Jagannath. The Jagannath Temple Rath\\nYatra here got a new chariot after a gap of 12 years./p\\n\\npThis chariot has been prepared for 45 days. The chariot is 42 feet tall,\\n26 feet long, and 26 feet wide, and it cost 40 lakhs. The day of Akshaya\\nTritiya saw the start of the chariot construction by carpenters. Brightly\\ncolored canopies in either red, black, yellow, or green are placed atop the\\nchariots. Lord Jagannath uses red and yellow, Lord Balaram uses red and green,\\nwhile Goddess Subhadra uses red and black. All the chariots have separate\\nfeatures to distinguish them from each other. Lord Jagannath's chariot is\\ncalled Chakradhwaja or Nandhighosa, which simply describes the tumultuous and\\nblissful sound. On the celebration, day devotees pull the chariots to\\nmausibadi. This year�s Rath yatra was more\\nspecial as it was the Nabakalebar Rath Yatra where all the Lords got new avatar\\nafter nineteen years. The return journey of Lords will be celebrated as Bahuda\\nyatra on 9th July 2022. The Rath began to move in an atmosphere of devotion,\\nraising emotions as the most anticipated moment had finally arrived./p",

    "description": "The Festival of Chariots: Chariots of Lord Jagannath, better known as Ratha Yatra is celebrated every year at Puri, the temple town in Odisha, on the second (dwitiya) day of shukla pakhya (waxing cycle of moon) of Āshādha Māsa (3rd month of Odia calendar). This nine-day festivity marked by various rituals and traditions going to be held during 1st to 9th July 2023, during the rainy season in Odisha. The presiding deities of the Jagannath Temple, Puri's main temple, Lord Jagannath, Lord Balabhadra and Goddess Subhadra, with the celestial wheel - Sudarshana Chakra are removed from the temple in a ceremonial procession to their chariots. The huge, colourfully decorated chariots are drawn by multitude of devotees on the bada danda, the grand avenue to the Gundicha Temple (Gundicha– King Indradyumna's Queen), two miles away to the North. On their way back from the Gundicha Temple, the three deities stop for a while near the Mausi Maa Temple (Aunt's abode) and have an offering of the Poda Pitha, which is a special type of pancake supposed to be the Lord's favourite. After a stay for seven days, the deities return to their abode. As per the deion in the Skanda Purana, among the twelve Yatras of Lord Jagannatha, Ratha Yatra or Shree Gundicha Yatra is considered the most famous one.According to ‘Bamadev Samhita’ those who can witness four deities on the Simhasana (the sacred seat) of Gundicha Temple for a week, they along with their ancestors would get a place in the heavenly abode i.e. Baikuntha for all time to come. As per this text those who can hear about this great festival they also get the desired result. Besides this, those who study the rituals of the divine festival and make other aware of the same they can also get a place in his holy abode. The Ratha Yatra of the ‘four dieties’ takes place on the 2nd day of the bright fortnight of Ashadha for the overall well-being of the mankind. In the Skanda purana it has been described that no festival of Mahaprabhu is more important than that of the Shree Gundicha yatra. Because, Shree Hari the supreme Lord of the cosmos rides & his chariot in a very delightful mood to the Gundicha Temple to fulfil His pledged command. As the chariot is a symbol of ‘Sandhini Sakti’ mere touch of the chariot would confer compassion of Lord Shree Jagannatha on the devotees. The famous verse in this context is as follows: ‘Ratha tu Vamanam drustva punarjanma na vidyate.",

    "description": "Bonalu is one of the most popular and widely celebrated festivals in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. Celebrated in the month of Ashadam, the month-long festivities take place to thank Goddess Mahakali as women across the state dress in traditional attire and offer Bonam to the goddess. A bonam or meal consists of cooked rice with jaggery, curd and water which is placed inside an earthen pot. Each of these pots is decorated with flowers and carried by women on their heads to offer to the deity.\\n\\nThe origins of the festival date back to the 19th century when a battalion of Hyderabad Military prayed to the goddess to eradicate the plague that had devastated the city. If the goddess did so, the battalion would install an idol of Mahakali in Hyderabad. It is believed that the goddess did eradicate it and the battalion installed the idol. The festival holds great significance and hence In 2014, when the state of Telangana was formed, Bonalu was declared the State Festival.\\n\\nThe festivities start from the Golconda Fort as women carrying bonalu walk and reach the temple. Women carrying bonalu are considered to possess the spirit of the goddess, hence as they approach the temple, devotees sprinkle water to pacify the spirit. Traditional dance forms like Potharaju Dance is performed in many parts of the state.",

The rare festival is a good mix of devotion and fun. Much like other festivals, it encourages the villagers to come together and promote unity. Chikal Kalo is celebrated on the grounds of a temple dedicated to the mother son duo Devaki and Krishna. The temple is said to be unique to Marcel as no other temple of sorts is said to be existing elsewhere in the country.  The temple contains idols of Krishna known as ‘Balkrishna’ who is held in the arms of his mother Devaki.The celebrations begin on ‘Aashadi Ekadashi’ which falls on the 11th Day of Aashadh month according to the Hindu calendar. Devotees gather in the temple to sing Bhajans (Devotional songs) for two straight days. On the second day, people participating in the muddy ritual take oil from the lamp in the temple and apply it over their bodies. The mud is sprayed with water in advance to make it ready for celebration. After applying oil participants enact various games that Lord Krishna is supposed to have played as a child amongst his friends. Musical instruments such as cymbals, drums  and bells add to the flavour.",

    "description": "The Directorate of Tourism, Jammu in collaboration with Divisional Administration Jammu organises “Shri Amarnath Ji Yatra 2023” to the UT of Jammu and Kashmir. As per the Folklore and Information available it is believed that behind the discovery of the Holy Shrine lies an interesting story. Centuries ago Maa Parvati asked Shivji to let her know why and when he started wearing the beads of heads (Mund Mala), to which Bhole Shankar replied, “whenever you are born I add more heads to my bead”. Parvati said, “I die again and again, but you are Immortal. Please tell me the reason behind this”. \"Bhole Shankar replied that for this you will have to listen to the Amar Katha\" Shiv agreed to narrate the detailed story to Maa Parvati. He started his journey to a lonely place where no living being could listen to the immortal secret and ultimately choose Amarnath Cave. In the hush-hush, he left his Nandi (the Bull which He used to ride) at Pahalgam. At Chandanwari, he released Moon (Chand) from his hair (Jataon). At the banks of Lake Sheshnag, he released the snakes. He decided to leave his Son Ganesha at Mahagunas Parvat. At Panjtarni, Shivji left the Five Elements behind (Earth, Water, Air, Fire and Sky) which give birth to life and of which he is the Lord. After leaving behind all these, Bhole Shankar entered the Holy Amarnath Cave along with Parvati Maa and took his Samadhi. To ensure that no living being is able to hear the Immortal tale, he created Kalagni and ordered him to spread fire to eliminate every living thing in and around the Holy Cave. After this he started narrating the secret of immortality to Maa Parvati. But as a matter of chance a pair of pigeons overhead, hear the story and became immortal. Many pilgrims report seeing the pair of pigeons at the Holy Shrine even today and are amazed as to how these birds survive in such a cold and high altitude area.",

The festival of Guru Purnima is celebrated with great reverence and devotion,\\nfollowed by a grand puja organized to mark the occasion.\\n\\nWhen Gopalrao Gund was\\nfinally blessed with a child after requesting Sai Baba to alleviate him from\\nhis long-term disconsolateness of not having a child, he asked Baba’s\\npermission and held a thanksgiving fair on Lord Ram’s birthday which coincided\\nwith the auspicious Urus Day, a Muslim festival honouring a Sufi Saint. It\\nseems that Sai Baba had some ulterior motive behind this. It was his strategy\\nto get the two communities together on one day – the unification of Hindus and\\nMuslims. The celebrations are done on the same day, every year, even today.\\n\\nIn Shirdi, two locally\\nsignificant customs are carried out during the festival – the sack of wheat\\nthat is kept in Dwarakamani is changed and the old one is taken to Prasadalaya\\nto be used there, and secondarily the Dwaraka mani flags are hoisted on the two\\ncorners of the mosque by Damu Anna Rasne of Ahmednagar, a friend of Gopalrao,\\nwho has been blessed with two sons by Baba and another devotee\\nNanasaheb Nimonkar. Descendants of these two devotees are continuing this\\ntradition and the flags are brought in and offered at Sai Baba’s Samadhi (tomb)\\nbefore taking the grand procession. The procession begins at the house of three\\ncarpenters who took the responsibility to mend the broken mosque, as an honour.\\n\\nThen follows the sandal\\nprocession – a tradition of anointing sandal paste. To participate in the\\nsandal procession, devotees from various states and neighboring places turned\\nup at the dharga (mosque). Later at the day, prayers are offered and some\\nreligious activities are organized, accompanied by devotional music like\\nbhajan, public reading of ures and devotional texts. From then on feeding\\nthe poor was done on a large scale. The Samadhi Mandhir stays open for the\\nentire night during this occasion with qawali sessions and bhajan songs. Every year lakhs of devotees from all the religions throng to the temple to seek darshan and blessings from the \" Then Shirdi Sai Baba \".",

    "description": "Guru Hargobind Sahib Ji was the first Saint Soldier among Sikh Gurus. Took up 2 swords of Miri and Piri, constructed Akal Takht – a symbolic of Raj Satta and Throne of the Eternal God.\\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\\n                            Guru Hargobind (1595-1644)\\nThe son of Guru Arjan Dev, ascended the throne of Sikh Guruship on the martyrdom of his father when he was only 11 years old. He was trained in the art of horsemanship, swordsmanship, hunting, and wrestling. Guru Hargobind built Akal Takht as the temporal seat of authority opposite the Golden Temple in Amritsar. He built a small fort, called Lohgarh and kept a small army (cavalry).\\nThe Guru ordained his Sikhs to bring offerings of weapons and horses. So Jehangir (Mughal ruler) imprisoned the Guru in the fort of Gwalior for about 12 years, though later on the Emperor tried to befriend him. Guru Hargobind traveled far and wide including Kashmir and Uttar Pradesh. He fought four battles against the Mughal ruler Shah Jahan and inflicted heavy casualties on the enemy. The Guru lived the last year of his life in meditation, leading a simple life. Finally, he appointed his grandson Har Rai as his successor.\\nConcept of Miri Piri\\nThe concept of Miri-Piri laid by Guru Hargobind Sahib Ji can be understood as follows;\\n‘Pir’ means sainthood and ‘Miri’ denotes sovereignty. The sequence has been placed as such that sainthood is mentioned first and then temporal making it clear that the prerequisite to bear arms is knowledge and spirituality.\\nThis concept has also been utilized by Guru Gobind Singh Ji multiple times under a similar context but as a different name where Miri=Tegh and Piri= Degh. The Degh and Tegh are Persian words, meaning kettle and the sword respectively. Death literally means cooking-pot where it symbolizes the free kitchen (Langar) and sainthood. Whereas, Tegh means sword which symbolizes dignity, power, and sovereignty.",

People perform special rituals at homes and on the premises of temples as part of the Vavu Bali ceremony. In certain parts of Kerala, Vavu Bali is held as a mass event, with the most notable ceremonies taking place on the banks of the Periyar near the Shiva temple in Aluva and on the Papanasam beach in Varkala.\\n\\nHindu customs and rituals give much importance to the rituals that are to be performed after death, commonly denoted as \"shesha kriya\" in Malayalam (with \"shesham\" meaning \"after\" and \"kriya\" denoting \"rituals\"). According to Hindu custom, when a family member dies, the younger ones in the family have to perform Bali (also called Pithru Tharpanam) to liberate the soul from the shackles of worldly life and help the soul achieve eternal peace. The Bali carried out on Karkidaka Vavu (Karkidakavavu) day is of great importance. While the regular custom is to perform the ritual on the basis of calculations of the star of the day the family member died, Karkidaka Vavu Bali is performed regardless of these calculations. The rites are conducted in accordance with Hindu customs and performed on beaches and waterways.\\n\\nHindus in Kerala never fail to perform this ritual on the day of Karkidaka Vavu.",

    "description": "The centuries-old Gugudu Kullayi Swamy and Hanuman temples at Gugudu village in Narpala mandal of Anantapur district are all set for Muharram.At least three lakhs devotees are expected to have darshan at the temple and give offerings to the deities during the ongoing Muharram. Gugudu, a small village, around 27 km from Anantapur, is home to the shrine of Kullayi Swamy, also known as Pir Kullayappa. Some believe that Pir Kullayappa is Imam Hussain, the eldest grandson of Prophet Muhammad.This belief is evident in the way Muharram in Rayalaseema region is observed; every manjlis (congregation) is a blend of Hindu and Islamic customs and rituals.         An interesting story is repeated by many devotees in Gugudu on how the two faiths are linked. According to the legend, Gugudu means the nest of Guha, who is none other than the boatman who helped Rama, Sita and Lakshmana reach the other side of the river. The legend goes on that Sri Rama came to the area in the avatar of a Pir Kullayappa, ‘God with a skull cap’.        Local Muslims believe that Kullayappa was one of the fakirs sent by Baba Fakhruddin to spread the message of Sufism.\\nResidents of Gugudu believe the fakirs took refuge in a dry well on the outskirts of Gugudu and built their khwankhas (halls for meditation) adjacent to the Hanuman temple. Devotees worship both Lord Hanuman and Kullayaswamy.        Erstwhile Muslim rulers - Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan of Mysore (1750–1799) introduced the public rituals of Muharram in Rayalaseema region. These rituals are under an umbrella of Sufi practices and with the participation of Hindus, have spawned a pluralistic devotional culture .\\nEndowment department officials said that elaborate arrangements are being made for the 13th day of Muharram where at least three lakh devotees from south India are expected to take part in the Agnigundam",

    "description": "Renuka, also known as Yellamma, is a Hindu goddess worshipped predominantly in the South Indian states. She is also known as the mother of Parashurama, the sixth avatar of the god Vishnu. The temple was built in the memory of Goddess Renuka, the wife of Rishi Jamadagni and mother of Parshuram. It is said that Parshuram wished to spend his life at the feet of his mother and it is because of this reason, the mother-son duo meet every year during the commencement of annual Renuka Fair.          It is said that, In a hurry to bring back his mother life, Parashuram accidentally placed the low-caste woman's head with his mother's body. Sage Jamadagni accepted this new form of his wife Renuka. The original head of Renuka was from then onwards worshipped as Yellamma. And thus the Goddess is referred as Renuka Yellamma.The deity in the temple is the goddess Yellamma or Ellama or Renuka, revered as a fertility goddess.Special Pooja will be performed on  every Tuesday and Friday in Grand manner for Goddess Renuka.           This temple is located  at a distance of 8 KMs from Kurnool  and  Most  of  the devotees  comes from Telangana and Rayalaseema in summer season to worship Goddess Renuka .",

    "description": "The importance of Babadham increases during the month of Shrawan. During this period, lakhs of devotees throng the Baba Baidyanath temple. Most of them first visit Sultanganj, which is 105 km from Babadham. In Sultanganj, the Ganges flows to the North. It is from this place that the devotees collect water in their kanwars and carry the holy Ganges water, with the kanwars on their shoulders. They walk 109 km up to Baba Baidyanath temple at Babadham reciting Bol Bam on the way. On reaching Babadham, the kanwarias first take a dip in the Shivaganga to purify themselves, and then enter the Baba Baidyanath temple, where the Ganges water is offered to the Jyotirlingam.",

    "description": "The festival of Padhinettam Perukku also known as \"Aadi Perukku\" is held on the 18th day of the Tamil month of Aadi. \"Perukku\" means \"raising\" in Tamil. This festival is a reflection of the River Kaveri's rise due to the monsoon rains. The Tamil calendar month of Aadi is marked by festivities and fervour honouring Water and other natural resources. Prayers and pujas are performed throughout this month to express gratitude to the mighty Goddesses for abundant natural resources.\\nThe River Palar flows through the village of Kodaiyanchi near the Vaniyambadi town of Thirupathur district. The banks of the river are home to a 1000-year-old temple dedicated to Lord Shiva- Arulmigu Kasi Viswanathar Temple and Lord Murugan - Arulmigu Murugan Temple. Hundreds of devotees gather on the day of “Padhinettam Perukku” to celebrate the occasion by offering sweet Pongal to the deity. Mulaipari, also known as the sprouting or germination of nine grains (Navadhanyam) in clay mud pots, is a crucial ceremony that is performed in the temples during this occasion.  Nine different varieties of cultivated grains are packed in the earthen pots that the procession devotees carry on their heads as they move towards the river where the grains are dissolved.\\nThe newly wedded couples from the surrounding villages come to this festival to replace their \"mangalya thread\" tied on the day of their marriage with a new one along with gold coins and trinkets. Women make a lamp using rice and jaggery, set it upon plantain leaves, and let it float along the River Palar.",

    "description": "The Tamil month of Aadi marks the start of the monsoon season in Tamil Nadu (between the months of July and August). Monsoon rains throughout this month cause rivers' water levels to rise, leading to the commemoration of \"Aadi Perukku\".  Aadiperukku is a distinctive South Indian festival celebrated on the 18th day of the Aadi month.  This day is celebrated to respect the Goddess of Water and Nature. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\\n                            The Krishnagiri Dam, constructed between the years of 1955 and 1957, is located between the Krishnagiri and Dharmapuri districts of Tamil Nadu. The water supply of this dam is obtained from the River Thenpennai. Thousands of acres of land are dependent on the supply of water through this dam. Goddess Parvathi Devi is honoured on this auspicious day by being offered poojas, omams and food offerings. The gushing water is what makes people joyful and glad when the dams' shutters are opened as the holds a special place in the hearts of the farmers as they await and praise this water source for farming and harvest. The Mulaipari ceremony, also known as the sprouting or germination of nine grains (Navadhanyam) in clay mud pots, is an important ritual. The farmers belonging to the surrounding villages fill nine different varieties of grown grains in clay pots and dissolve them in the gushing water.  On this auspicious day, family members and friends pray together for a consistent water supply that would ultimately result in a good harvest. During this festival, women gather to change their “thaali” (nuptial thread) and cook sweet Pongal. The worshippers bathe in the sacred water and perform poojas.  Hundreds of people flock to the KPR Dam to respect and celebrate the water source that will provide them with a bountiful harvest during the year.",

    "description": "The handloom industry represents the diverse and rich cultural history of our nation and provides a vital source of income for those living in rural and semi-rural areas. With more than 70% of all weavers and related employees being women, it is also a sector that specifically emphasizes the empowerment of women. With its roots in nature, it uses environmentally friendly production techniques that need little in the way of resources and power, and it gives designers the freedom to develop to keep up with rapidly shifting consumer tastes and fashion trends. Every year on the eve of National Handloom Day on the 7th of August, the Department of Handlooms and Textiles, Government of Tamil Nadu organizes the National Handloom Expo to celebrate the art of weaving. The expo invites more than 50 stalls from weavers across the country to display the handwoven textiles made of cotton, silk and other materials. The expo also consists of various food stalls to satiate the hunger of the spectators. This event attracts a large number of local and foreign tourists inviting them to stroll along the stalls and shop the handlooms.",

    "description": "The Kavadi Festival at Arulmigu Subramaniya Swamy Temple, Tiruchendur is one of the most spectacular celebrations in Tamil Nadu. The presiding deity of this temple is Lord Murugan. The temple is also one of the six abodes of Lord Murugan. Every year during the Tamil month of Aadi (in between July and August), the temple commemorates a grand celebration inviting lakhs of devotees across the nation. The Kavadi festival is a fusion of religion, sacrifice, splendour, and tradition. The Kavadi is the extreme suffering and sacrifices a devotee endures in order to offer his devotion to Lord Muruga. Traditionally, a kavadi is a wooden pole with two baskets suspended from it which contains offerings to the deity. Peacock feathers and a large number of brass bells are used to embellish the Kavadis. Rice, milk, or any other items that the devotee has pledged to give the Lord in his Vow are often placed in the two baskets. The  Kavadi bearer follows intense fasting and restrictions until the day of the offering. The Agni Kavadi can be noticed during this festival in which the devotee must cross a pit of flaming coals while carrying the Kavadi. The Kavadi bearer exuberantly marches across the red-hot embers, encouraged by the spectators, along with the sound of the drums, and the aroma of the burning incense sticks. Every year, lakhs of devotees throng the temple to celebrate this spectacular festival.",

    "description": "Basavana Bagewadi is a historic town that is famous as the birthplace of the 12th-century saint, poet, and social reformer Basavanna, also known as Basaveshwara. He is believed to have founded the Lingayat sect, which is devoted to Shiva worship.\\n\\nBasava was born in the town of Basavana Bagewadi in the year 1131 CE to Maadarasa and Madalambike who belonged to an orthodox Brahmin family. At a young age, Basava left home to devote 12 years of his life to studying and meditating at the feet of his Guru in Kudalasangama. \\n\\nBasava later married Gangambike who was the daughter of a minister in the court of the Kalchuri king. On the death of his father-in-law, Basava became the minister in the court. He used his position to initiate many social reforms and spread Shaivism. He composed simple poems with deep meaning, known as Vachanas in the local language, to spread the message of Shaivism. Basava attained nirvana at Kudala Sangama, the same place where he had started his spiritual pursuit.\\n\\nThere is an ancient temple in Basavana Bagewadi that has been restored and renovated recently. The temple seems to date back to the Chalukyan era and is similar to the temple at Kudala Sangama. The temple is an east-facing temple with Garbhagriha or sanctum sanctorum, an Antharala, Natyamantapa and Sabhamantapa. It is a sandstone structure barring the front portion which is of granite stone. \\n\\nThere is an idol of Basavanna (Nandi) facing the Shivaling in the sanctum. In the temple complex, there is a school building and also rooms for pilgrims. A few stone arches or Torangalu can be seen at the entrance of the temple",

    "description": "The Punitha Adaikalamadha Church, which is located at Elakkurichi in the Ariyalur district, holds a special celebration known as \"Kuthuvillaku Poojai\" every year in the month of August. During this festival, hundreds of devotees throng the church to celebrate this unique celebration with a brass lamp.\\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\\n                            The Punitha Adaikalamadha Church consists of a huge statue of Mother Adaikala Madha which is rested upon an 18-foot-high pedestal. This statue was installed by the Constantine Joseph Beschi popularly known as Veeramamunivar. He has contributed greatly to the growth and progress of the Tamil language by authoring 23 books known as \"Thembavani\". \\nThe Kuthuvillaku Poojai invites a large number of women devotees to gather and worship the Mother \"Adaikala Matha\". The oil in the lamp represents the impurities like envy, hate, and desire in the human mind. The soul, often known as the self, is symbolized by the cotton in the lamp. When the wick burns the oil, the lamp emits light. Therefore, lighting the lamps signifies the desire to put an end to selfish and materialistic thoughts and dedicate our souls to Mother Mary. It is believed that the lighting of this \"Kuthuvillaku\" will bring wealth and prosperity to the devotees. During this festival, hundreds of women gather at the chapel of this church holding the “kuthuvillaku”- a brass lamp and adorn it with aromatic flowers. The devotees light the lamp by offering prayers to the Almighty for well-being.",

Kousar Nag is one of the highest altitude springs in the upper reaches of Reasi district bordering Kashmir region near Kulgam-Reasi Border. The Holy Spring is one of the cleanest water bodies in the region and shimmers with fresh, crystal clear glacial waters covering an area of five km in length and two-and-half kilometres in breadth. Kausar Nag Lake is 2 kilometres in area, surrounded by snow capped mountains and fresh blue waters.According to belief, the lake was created by Lord Vishnu by stamping with his foot, and thus it is also referred to as Lord Vishnu Pad. The ‘Chhari Mubarak’, the saffron-robed holy mace of Lord Shiva, is also taken along with the yatra. The lake is the primary source of the Veshaw River, a tributary of Jhelum. This lake is considered sacred by the Hindu pilgrims. There are two routes traditionally used for Hindu pilgrimages (called yatra) to the lake, one through Kulgam in the Kashmir Valley and the other via Reasi in the Jammu region. The Reasi route continues to be used for the pilgrimage as the other route has been abandoned. The four-day-long historical Kousar Nag yatra is an annual Yatra undertaken by Hindu pilgrims every year. It is flagged off from District Headquarters Reasi and passes through captivating landscapes of  Salal, Arnas, Dharmari, Mahore, Sungari, Chassana, sari and finally reaches to Kounsar Nag. There is lot of supernatural happenings that the pilgrims experience and report.",

Worship of Snake  is an important ritual in Maharashtra, and on this festival, cobras made of clay are venerated in homes. It is mainly celebrated for two reasons. Firstly, the abode of the nags (snakes) forms the bottom of the patal lok & the blessings of the nags are sought for the well-being of the family. Secondly, the nags (snakes) keep the crops safe from rats and rodents, and so the farmers pray to the nag-devta and offer their gratefulness. People make offerings of sweets and milk to the snake deity. Cobras are carried by snake charmers in baskets and they collect offerings from the public in the streets. The day is celebrated with dances and songs in the streets. People throng nag temples and also Shiva temples, since the nag is very closely associated with Lord Shiva.",

    "description": "Sikhs around the globe will celebrate Guru Arjan Dev Ji Gurgaddi Diwas 2022 on August 29th, Monday. This Gurpurab marks the day when the 4th Guru Ramdas Ji passed the spiritual throne of Guru Nanak to his beloved son Arjan Guru, just a day before ascending to Sach-Khand.\\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\\nEach of the ten Sikh Gurus or “the dispeller of darkness”, as the term Guru connotes, appeared in the land of five rivers, Punjab, during the span of 239 years (1469 to 1708 A.D., Guru Nanak to Guru Gobind Singh), had a very distinct and distinguished role to play, in their short sojourn on this planet, to alleviate the sufferings of mankind, spiritual, as well as, temporal.\\nGuru Arjan was born in Goindwal, district Amritsar, on April 15, 1563 A.D. to Mata Bhaniji, the holy consort of Guru Ramdas and daughter of Guru Amardas, the third Sikh Guru. He was the youngest of three brothers namely, Pirthi Chand, Mahadev, and Arjan.\\nHe was married first during the lifetime of Guru Ramdas to Mata Ramkaur but this noble lady did not live long and passed away in the year 1589 A.D. leaving no issue. He was remarried in 1590 A.D. to Mata Ganga, daughter of Bhai Sangat Ram or Kishan Chand of village Lau near Pbillaur. Mata Ganga was a lady of deep faith and intelligence. One son was born to her in 1595 A.D. at village Vadali, near Amritsar when Guru Arjan was in transitory habitation there for the unfortunate reasons of undue hostility and harassment by Pirthia and his ill malevolently assisted by state officials. He claimed that the seat of Guruship was his right by birth as the eldest son totally oblivious of his unsuitability to be a leader of an immature spiritual institution.\\nGuru Arjan Dev is the central-most figure of Sikh history and is on all accounts a unique personality such as has no parallel. Coming as he did between Guru Nanak, the founder of Sikh Theocracy, and Guru Govind Singh, the creator of the Khalsa Brotherhood, Guru Arjan Dey combined the prophetic qualities of the one with the dynamic personality of the other. The more you read him the clearer becomes the conviction that Guru Arjan Dev was the very head and heart of Nanak. Were it not for him Sikhism would have run to seed, and it would not have been what it is today: a mighty pipal that has its roots deep in the bowels of Eternity. A worthy son of the worthy father, Guru Ram Das, it was Guru Arjan Dey who first proved in his person that the Guru’s son is really the fit person to step into the shoes of his father. Guru Nanak selected Angad in preference to his own sons, but evidently, the holy influence of Nanak was as much at work in the lineal line as in the outside world, so that a century of preparation had changed the very spiritual seed. The Guru held the gaddi for about 25 years, and these days were certainly the most successful in the expansion and consolidation of the Sikh religion.",

    "description": "Baba Bakala were the last words of Guru Harkishan ji and his last words indicated the next would-be Guru. This was an amazing incident; and the Sikhs remember this with pride and affection.\\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\\n                            After the demise of the Guru Harkishan ji utter confusion prevailed. This was regarding the selection of the next Guru. But God wanted to show them the way and so, Makhan Shah’s ship was caught in a storm. In this circumstance everyone prayed to God and Makahan Shah also vowed to donate 500 Dinars to the Guru after he was rescued from the danger.\\nAfter his return, Makar Singh went to Bakala and offered 200 Dinars to each one opting to be a Guru. As he expected, no one except true Guru recognized the exact amount and asked why he was giving just 2 Dinars while he had pledged for 500. Instantly everyone understood the true Guru Teg Bahadurji who is said to be the 9th Sikh Guru.\\nThus Bakala came to be the sacred place for the Sikhs and a place for the holy pilgrimage. Since only a person with an insight may discover the truth, Teg Bahadurji became the next Guru. “The greater the difficulty, the more the glory in surmounting it.\" It was a difficult task but since Teg Bahadur succeeded he made his power known to all. A beautiful Gurudwara Sahib stands at the spot where Guru Tegh Bahadur used to meditate in an underground cell.\\nThis small village where Guru Tegh Bahadur revealed himself subsequently, came to be called Baba ¬Bakala. The Gurudwara has many beautiful paintings pertaining to the Sikh history. People gather in thousands on every amavas night. Besides an Annual Fair (Jor Mela) is held on Rakshabandhan (Hindu festival) day when many people throng this holy place from all over the country. It is situated only 3 km away from Butari railway station and is well connected by roads to important towns of Punjab.",

The Lambada and Mathura communities celebrate Teej with religious fervour and gaiety in their respective thandas. The Teej festival is spread over 9 days and is celebrated in the Sravana month of the Hindu calendar. This usually coincides with the month of August according to the Gregorian calendar. The Teej festival begins on the day of the full moon in the Sravan month on the day on which the festival of Rakhi or Raksha Bandhan is celebrated. The Teej festival involves multiple rites and rituals that the women perform with the help of the menfolk. However, the main feature of the festival involves the planting of seeds in baskets specially woven for the purpose.Teej festival starts with the sowing of wheat in woven bowls, which soon sprout up as wheatgrass. Women of these two communities participate in the traditional rituals of Teej festival of nine days. Many rituals are involved in the Teej festival and women perform these rituals with the help of their men during the nine-days. The last-day, the women immerse the sprout bowls into local lakes or ponds. Women worship Jagadamba in Teej and seek the Goddess’ blessing in getting a good husband and married women pray for the well-being of their husbands. The women play and dance to the tune of traditional songs while circling the Teej or the decorated temple-like structure made of clay. Mathura (Mathura Labana) women make the temple like structure with the support of 21 sticks with the clay ( black soil ) they collect from their agriculture fields and decorate them with ornaments.",

    "description": "Bihula is a prominent folklore in some portions of Bengal, Bihar, and Jharkhand. It is about the dedication of a woman to her husband and goddess at the same time. Again, it is culturally rich, as the name is mentioned in traditional Hindu sagas and passed on as folklore. The serpent goddess Mansa is the center of it, the story depicts how she established herself as a goddess among the common people overcoming the prejudice against her ability to be a goddess to all. Special Ashtanag rituals are offered to Devi during the Asaahad, Shravan month of the traditional Hindu calendar. Some say that to save one's life from snake bites and ease the life of kids one has to offer her prayers. District Bhagalpur in Bihar has a major festival-like fair organized to recognize the Goddess and her kindness, which is also called Bihula-Bishari. It is dominated by arts crafts, plays and shows that showcase snakes as their centres. The splendid Manjusha craftsmanship has always been a big part of this festival. People aware of the folklore in the prominent regions take part in the yearly celebration.",

Every year, this festival gives participants an opportunity to show their skills in “Patang bazzi” which further boosts adrenaline rush among all the attendees/viewers.\\nThe thrill and excitement lingers in the air and it is enchanting for anyone who celebrates the pleasure of flying kites.\\nKite Festival remains always a popular festival in all over the India. The significance of this festival is to show the awakening of the gods from their deep sleep. Through India's history, it is said that India created the tradition of kite flying due to the kings and royals, later followed by Nawabs, who found the sport entertaining, and as a way to display their skills and power. Over time, as the sport became popular, it began to reach the masses and is therefore quite popular in Jammu also. \\nThe idea behind organising the said event this year, is to revive the age old tradition of flying kites and provide the residents and tourists of Jammu a platform to witness “Patang bazzi”. Apart from simple kite flying, the event shall include showcasing of flying of multiple kites simultaneously and flying of mega kite designed with Jammu Tourism Colours. The venue shall be decorated with different colour kites making it appealing to anyone who witness the event.",

It is said that around 200 years ago there was a severe drought in this region. The descendants of the Bhoi community made a 5.5 ft idol of Meghraja from the soil of Narmada river and worshiped it the whole night. Even after their immense hard work there were no signs of rain. The villagers were furious, they decided that if it does not rain the next morning they will destroy the Meghraja idol and the very next day it started raining miraculously. Thereafter, this day is celebrated as the Meghraja Visarjan festival every year by the Bhoi community. The festivities can be seen at only one place in the entire Gujarat.",

    "description": "The birth of Lord Shri Krishna is celebrated with huge pompous all across Gujarat. The Lord Sri Krishna established his kingdom in Dwarka, Gujarat and ruled the part of Saurashtra. The birth celebration of Lord Sri Krishna famously known as Janmashtami or Nandotsav. The International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) is known colloquially as the Hare Krishna movement or Hare Krishnas, is a Gaudiya Vaishnava religious organization. Its core beliefs are based on Hindu ures, particularly the Bhagavad Gita and the Bhagavata Purana. ISKCON was formed to spread the practice of Bhakti yoga, the practice of love of God in which those involved (bhaktas) dedicate their thoughts and actions towards pleasing Lord Krishna, whom they consider the Supreme Lord.The celebrations at ISKCON revolve around the all-encompassing Lord Krishna, and Janmashtami is perhaps the biggest of them all. On this day, ISKCON temple in Vadodara is decorated and devotees come in large numbers to rejoice. The grand festival goes on for the entire day, and besides puja, there are a lot of other activities happening. ISKCON prepares Prasadam for devotees, which is first offered to the Supreme Lord as Bhoga, and then there are games and activities organized for children in some temples. The Deities of Radha Krishna are adorned with beautiful flowers, amazing ornaments, and celebrations of Janmashtami are conducted with love and devotion. On the day of Janmashtami, the temple hall is decorated with beautiful and fragrant flowers and thronged by devotees who are eager to have Darshan of the Lord and serve Him. There are varieties of flowers used for the beautification of the temples, and the festival starts from the early morning. One of the main rituals on this day is the ceremonial bathing of the Lord Krishna, also known as Abhishekam. Both Radha and Krishna, and even Balaram get the ceremonial bathing, and then there is Mangal Aarti and more. Prasadam is distributed among devotees, and as mentioned earlier there are activities going on throughout the day with melodious Kirtan and chanting of the Holy name practically the entire day. At midnight, the Lordships are offered an Aarti yet again, and hundreds of men and women watch with teary eyes, full of love and devotion for the Supreme Lord. The festivities go on until the next day as well. Janmashtami is a grand celebration to commemorate the appearance of Lord Krishna, who is believed to be the Supreme Lord or the Lord of the Lords. It is the celebration of joy, love, and divinity.",

    "description": "Varalakshmi Vratam is a significant practice that reveres Goddess Varalakshmi, symbolizing wealth, prosperity, and well-being in Hindu culture. Beyond material gains, this observance embodies values of devotion, family harmony, and gratitude. The rituals of fasting and prayer during the vratam underscore self-discipline and empathy, fostering spiritual connection. Moreover, the collective celebration reinforces community bonds and cultural identity.\\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\\n                            \\nAt the heart of this tradition lies the Sri Lakshmi Tirupatamma Devastanam, a temple with origins dating back to the seventeenth century. The temple holds the remarkable history of Sri Tirupatamma, a symbol of devotion and resilience. Despite challenges, her unwavering faith in Lord Venkateswara sustained her and the region. Her teachings emphasize the connection between respecting women and prosperity.\\nTragedy struck when her husband, Gopayya, lost his life to a tiger. Undeterred, Sri Tirupatamma's devotion never wavered. She entered Yogagni, displaying celestial powers and leaving a legacy. The Sri Lakshmi Tirupatamma temple stands as a manifestation of her promise, inviting pilgrims to seek solace, blessings, and inspiration. Each visit to the temple is an opportunity to connect with her legacy of devotion and resilience, immersing in a timeless story of faith and blessings.",

Kailash kund Yatra in Bhaderwah starts every year in the month of Bhadu on Dwadshi Tethi in Krishan Paksh that is in ending dates of august or early days of September. This year in 2023, it is starting on 11th of September, 2023 from village Gatha previously known as Ghoshta having the ancient temple of Sh. Vasuki Naag Ji Maharaj. The yatries take the same path, which was taken by Sh. Vasuki Naag Ji to reach Kailash Kund at the time when Garoodh Ji challenged him to fight. Shri Vasuki Naag Ji ran away to avoid the fight to keep respect of Garood's promise which he had made to his mother Vaneeta as both Garoodh ji and Vasuki Naag Ji were the sons of great saints Maharishi Kashyap. Kailash in Bhaderwah (Bhaderkashi) is called Kablas. It is a big lake situated at height of 14241 ft. from sea level. It is beautiful pure ice cold clear fresh water lake, surrounded by mountains and glaciers. It is the most attractive religious holy spot where Lord Shiva resided before Shri Vasuki Naag ji as the permanent occupant of the place. Yatra starts with beating of drums, blowing of flutes among the shouting of religious slogans by the people, first of all people worship the holy mace with flowers, chanting mantras and then proceed on their way. Further, by climbing mountain which is straight rocky strip called \"GOW PAEDA\"\" named as such because Shri Vasuki Naag ji had climbed this strip after becoming cow (called gow in bhaderwahi). It is the biggest pilgrimage of Northern India as stated by Lord Shiva to Mata Parvati in Vasuki Puran.In space Vasuki Naag ji is lying in such a way that there head is above village Nalthi, His right arm is over village Bheja and left arm over village Mathola as \"Chatur Bhuj Naag. His central body part is at Nagar whereas, his feet are at Gatha village, as per the written version. His family resides at Gatha, that is why ladies are not allowed to enter the inner side of the temple at Gatha village.\\nTaking bath and donating something to poor at this place is sacred and noblest job which is repaid in manifold, way to the donor after death. The holy mace comes back to Gatha, after taking dip in cold water of Kailash Kund.",

These girls are held in high regard as embodiments of the goddess, and they undertake sacred duties for the entire 15-day duration. The selection process for these girls is conducted by the priest of the Elai Kaatha Amman Temple, known as the Poosaari or Melavalasai.During the festivities, unmarried female devotees carry small clay dolls, while married women fill pitchers with milk and adorn them with coconut kernels, creating 'Madhu Kalayam' (milk pots mixed with Padhaneer). In a traditional procession, the revered Ambalakara is carried under an umbrella during the evening ceremonies. Following this, the seven girls dress as \"Amman\" - the Goddess and bestow blessings upon the people.The Elai Kaatha Amman Festival is a remarkable celebration that holds deep cultural and religious significance for the communities involved.",

Its fairs and festivals have profoundly enriched the culture of the people. “Mela Patt” having medieval origin occupies position among the fairs of Doda District.

The celebration is unique and historically traditional festival starts on the fifth day immediately after “Kailash Yatra” that is on the day of “Vinayak Chuturthi” or “Patharchoth”.\\nInitiation of Mela Patt dates back to the sixteenth century when Akbar the great, was much impressed by the spiritual power of Raja Nagpal, the ruler of Bhaderwah Principality, at the Mughal Court, attributed to the blessings of the serpent God Nag Raj Vasuki. On the evening of “Patharchoth” or “Vinayak Choth” the “Jahari” (the conical metallic pot) is carried by a representative belonging to Raj-purohit family in Bhaderwah. The calmness of the dark night is broken with slogans, “Jai Bolo Nagae Basik Ki Jai, Phir Bolo Sanchae Durbar ki Jai,” The procession passes through the Main Bazars of the town. It concludes at the Vasuki Dhera Temple. Next morning after routine worship in the Temple, the Jahari moves to the house of Rajgurus' in Mohalla Khakhal. The team of selected person of the locality called “Dashan” prepare the traditional “Patt Jhanki.” The patt, a heavy load of conical shape with Jahari on the top decorated with marigold flowers garlands and ‘Haraii' adorned with hundreds of cloth – pieces of gorgeous colours is now ready for exhibition.\\nWith the break of dawn on Nag Panchami i.e. Rishi Panchmi a devoted person carries this “Patt” on his head in a procession led by the ‘Chela' (Mystic Man) of the deity and the musicians proceed to “Ganesh Math” for paying homage to God. “Ganpati” then the procession reaches the compound of the Vasuk Dhera Temple. The Traditional dance is performed before the Naga Deity and this procession later, concludes at the house of Rajgurus in Khakhal. The devotees throng there to have Darshan of “Patt” and pay their homage to Nag Raj Basuki and Raja Nagpal.\\nThere is a lot of supernatural happenings that the pilgrims experience and report.",

The festival is celebrated during the Tamil month of Avani(between August and September).\\nThe Arulmigu Kulasai Mutharamman Devi Temple is a 300-year-old temple that was built in the port city of Kulasekarapattinam during the reign of King Maravarman Kulasekaran.

In contrast to how the rest of the state celebrates Dasara, the temple celebrates the festival for 12 days.   The Goddess Mutharamman is taken in procession and rested upon various vahanams (vehicles) on all days of this festival. \\nThe devotees who participate in this festival, follow \"viradham\"(fasting) by maintaining utmost purity of body, mind and soul.  The devotees also pledge to collect donations in accordance with an ancient custom while portraying various celestial deities, including the goddess Kali, Kings, monkeys, and beggars. The donations collected are offered to the goddess Mutharamman. The devotees who portray cosmic deities carry on an act as though they possess divine power and deliver predictions to the worshipers. Every year, lakhs of devotees congregate at this temple to witness, rejoice, and take part in this distinct festival.",

    "description": "Baba Buddha is accepted as one of the greatest Sikh personalities during the period of Sikh Gurus. He has a unique privilege of being blessed by the first six Gurus. He led a life of an ideal Sikh for more than one hundred years. He was one of closest companions of the guru Nanak (the first Guru of Sikhs). He is considered as one of the most revered and sacred saints among Sikhs. He was the first head Granthi (priest) of Sri Harmandir Sahib (Golden Temple Amritsar, Punjab) Baba Buddha, the most venerated primal figure among Sikhs was born on 6 October 1506 at the village of Katthu Nangal, 18 km northeast of Amritsar in a Randhawa family. Bura, as he was originally named, was the only son of Bhai Suggha Randhawa and Mai Gauran. He attained such an eminence in Sikh piety that at the time of installation of Bhai Lahina as Guru Angad  (Nanak II), Guru Nanak asked Bhai Buddha to apply the ceremonial tilak on Bhai Lehna’s forehead. He continued to serve the Gurus with complete dedication and remained an example for the growing body of disciples.The Guru spent his time in meditation for one year and six months. Sikhs could not trace the Guru. They approached Baba Budha, who led them to Khadur. He prevailed upon the Guru to give up seclusion and resume his duties. He subsequently retired to a bir (forest), where he tended the livestock of the Guru ka Langar. That place is now known as Bir Baba Buddha Sahib.",

One such great event is the Alpasi Festival, which usually falls in either October or November each year. \\nIts magnificent Aarattu ceremony, the holy bath in the sea for the deities, is the primary attraction.

He and some other Vaishya notables built this temple together.  The temple has a tall Galigopuram. The front doors are bursting with sculpture. The mythological sculptures are fascinating. There are photographs that tell the story of Vasavi's birth. Mahatma Gandhi (in 1929), Sringeri Prefects, Kanchi Kamakoti Prefects Legends also say that after listening to the news of Lord Sri Rama's Victory over the Demon Lord Ravana, Lord Vayu has decorated this place with festoon of golden flowers to welcome Lord Sri Rama on his way back towards North to Ayodhya.

    "description": "The Festival of Nine Nights, called Navarathiri, is one of the most well-known and extensively celebrated Hindu festivals. Navarathiri is celebrated for nine days in the Tamil month of Purattasi (between September-October). The festival commemorates Goddess Durga's  (Parashakthi) triumph over the demon king Mahishasura. The day that marks triumph over the King is celebrated as Vijaya Dhasami, with great religious fervour on the tenth day to honour the victory of good over evil. On the occasion of Navarathiri, the devotees arrange “Golu” - a thematic display of dolls depicting a story or ure from the Hindy mythology. The figurines are arranged on a stepped- Dias covered in silk robes. The devotees invite their neighbourhood to visit their Golu and perform “Bhajanai” -chanting slogans while singing devotional songs to commemorate the triumph of righteousness over evil. After the bhajanai, the guests are provided with refreshments and gifts. The refreshments mostly consist of boiled pulses, and the return gifts include coconuts, betel leaves, fresh flowers, and turmeric-kumkum along with glass bangles and jewellery. The ninth day of the Navarathiri festival is celebrated as “Saraswathi Pooja” in Tamil Nadu. During this celebration, objects like musical instruments, books, machines, etc. are \"worshipped.\"\\nThe Navarathiri celebration is also celebrated with great zeal and zest in well-known Amman temples of the state, including the Kanchi Kamakshi Amman Temple (Kanchipuram), the Meenakshi Amman Temple(Madurai), the Samayapuram Mariamman Temple(Trichy), and many other temples.",

    "description": "On a social, cultural, and artistic level, Durga Puja is perhaps unlike any other religious festival in India. The underlying idea is to celebrate the homecoming of the goddess Durga as she makes her annual visit to her parents’ home with her four children Saraswati, Lakshmi, Ganesh, and Kartik, but in practice, it is the biggest socio-cultural festival of Bengal, cutting across all barriers. It is indeed a cultural heritage that has only grown stronger with every passing year.According to most scholars, Durga Puja in Bengal dates back to the medieval era (at least 11th century AD), though Bengal broke with tradition by performing the ritual in Autumn, whereas it was originally meant for Spring. Apparently, the unseasonable ritual was begun by Lord Rama, hero of the Ramayana, when he performed the puja in Autumn as part of his war against the demon king Ravana. Initially the preserve of rich aristocratic families, Durga Puja in its present form probably began in Bengal in the 16th century, when renowned zamindar Raja Kangsanarayan organised a lavish festival at a cost of nearly Rs 8 lakh at Taherpur in Nadia district towards the end of the century.Other landed aristocrats followed in his footsteps. In 1606, a Puja was organised by Bhabananda Majumdar of Nadia, an ancestor of the celebrated Raja Krishnachandra Roy. Kolkata probably got its first Durga Puja in 1610, courtesy Laxmikanta Majumdar, the founder of the Sabarna Roy Chowdhury family. This family is inextricably linked to the founding of Kolkata, since it was from them that the British East India Company acquired the rights to three villages – Sutanuti, Gobindapur, and Kalikata – which went on to become the city of Calcutta, later Kolkata.",

The original story explores the love and bond of two brothers when they were abandoned by their mother. Lendou and his younger brother shared a piece of Mim when their stomachs were wrought with hunger. It was Mim that got them through these hard times, brought them closer and taught them love. Mim is the last harvest of the year in the Kuki society. The people summon their deceased ancestors and pay their respects on this day. They offer tokens of maize, jewelry, clothing, bread and rice wine. Half of the harvest is dedicated and offered to the dead souls. It is customary to do so but not really mandatory. The souls of ancestors that have passed away are presumed to return to their homes during this festival. \\n \tThe festival is observed in the later part of December after the crop is harvested. It is celebrated every year. The festivities are celebrated for about two consecutive holidays",

    "description": "Chemrey monastery is one of the oldest spiritual establishments in Ladakh. In 1664 Lama Tagsang Ragspa, the pontiff of the great king Sengge Namgyal, founded Chemrey monastery in the king's memory. It was patronised by the king Deldan Namgyal and Queen Mother Skalzang Dolma, son and wife of Sengge Namgyal. The monastery features a two-storied Guru Padmasambhava statue. Dedicated to the Drukpa lineage of Tibetan Buddhism, the monastery celebrates its festival known as Chemrey Wangchok on the 28th and 29th of the ninth month of the Tibetan calendar. Alike other monasteries, mask dance and spiritual music invoke spirituality and devotion in the audience. Fun fact, the huge structure, perched on an imposing hill in the middle of Chemrey village was a royal fortress before it was converted into a monastery. When you visit the monastery, don't forget to inquire about its secular past as well. It might reveal some interesting wars stories, an indulgence we reserve for another time.",

    "description": "Diwali is the most popular celebration in India which is regarded as the “festival of lights” and represents the spiritual message of the power of light over darkness and knowledge over ignorance. The holiday of Diwali is mostly associated with Hinduism, although it is also joyfully observed by Sikhs and Jains. This festival’s spiritual importance represents the triumph of good over evil and light over darkness. Lakshmi, the goddess of riches, and Ganesha, the god of wisdom, are honoured at this celebration. Throughout the nation, its religious significance differs depending on the location. It is commemorated somewhere to honour Rama, Sita, and Lakshmana coming home after a lengthy 14-year exile (according to the Hindu epic Ramayana).\\n\\nSome people commemorate it in remembrance of the Pandavas’ return to their realm following 12 years of exile and 1 year of Agyatavas, as described in the Hindu epic Mahabharata. It is also thought to have begun when Goddess Lakshmi was born following the gods and demons’ churning of the seas. The western and some northern regions of India celebrate Diwali to mark the beginning of a new Hindu year. \\nFive days are devoted to celebrating Diwali. These five days are Dhanteras, Naraka Chaturdashi, Lakshmi Pooja, Govardhan Pooja, and Bhai Dooj. Diwali is a festival where people worship Saraswati, Lakshmi, and Lord Ganesha. On this day, worshipping the goddess Lakshmi is thought to bring success and wealth. People lit candles and diyas after evening puja to spread light. Cleaning homes, stores, and workplaces begin many days before Diwali.",

    "description": "The Festival of Lights known as Deepa Oli is celebrated all over the country during the months of October and November. According to the Samaskridhas, light is a potent symbol of knowledge and consciousness. It acts as a reminder of the importance of education, self-reflection, and improvement, which promote peace within and between communities. As per the Hindu mythology, Lord Krishna, Satyabhama, and Kali killed the demon Narakasura on this day.  The  Arulmigu Arunchalaeswarar Temple atTiruvannamalai organises special poojas and homams to commemorate the festival. The people of the state celebrate the festival by taking an oil bath in the morning, followed by several festivities. The homes are cleaned and adorned with “kolam” (rangoli) on their entrances along with flower decorations. People prepare a variety of sweets and savoury foods to offer as “neivedhyam” and to enjoy the occasion. The offerings include ukkarai, velli appam, idly, chutney, sambhar, omapudi, boondhi, jangri, pathir peni, and poli. The entire family gathers to perform the pooja, by lighting a  brass lamp called the \"Kuthu villaku\", and prays to the almighty for prosperity and happiness in their life. After the meal (neivedhyam) is offered to the gods, fruits, betel leaf, and betel nut are given to each family member following a sumptuous feast. A strong concoction called \"Deepa Oli legiyam,\" composed of ginger, pepper, ghee, and other ingredients is prepared to help foodies digest the lavish feast. Thala Deepa Oli, or their first Deepa Oli after marriage, holds special significance for newlyweds as they are showered with blessings and gifts. Several different types of crackers are burst during the day to commemorate this event. With all the colourful crackers being fired off at night, the sky appears sparkling and vibrant.",

The festival is typically observed in the Tamil month of Aippasi, which runs from mid-October to mid-November. The Brihadeeswarar Temple, also known as Tanjore Big Temple, hosts this celebration every year. \\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\\n                            \\nThe Raja Raja Chola was a brilliant ruler and administrator of the Chola Dynasty who constructed several temples. There are various wonders to be found inside the Brihadeeswarar temple. The temple is built using a rock-cut style with a foundation inclined to the Earth's axis uniquely.  This temple's tower was constructed with a lightweight monolithic, and it was meticulously built utilising the bipolar technique. This grand structure was designed with the ability to adjust to the rotation of the Earth, which is how it was able to stay erect even after Tanjore had been struck by five earthquakes. \\nThe Sathaya Vizha commemorates the celebration by adorning the statue of Raja Raja Cholan, which is located outside the temple, with silk robes. The abishekam (sacred bath) is done to the deity of  Lord Peruvudaiyar. The deity, Lord Peruvudaiyar is God Shiva in the shape of a lingam. The Perundheepa vazhipaadu(waving of lamps)  and Swami purappadu (holy procession) inside the temple is observed on the day of the festival. Each year, thousands of devotees congregate at this temple to lavishly celebrate this festival.",

    "description": "The Arulmigu Subramaniya Swamy Temple is located in Tiruchendur. The temple is also one of the six abodes of Lord Murugan. Every year during the Tamil month of Karthikai (in between the months of October and November) the temple celebrates a spectacular traditional 6-day event showing Lord Murugan defeating the evil Asura. According to the Hindu ures like the \"Skanda Purana\", the festival is celebrated to embark on the virtue of good over evil. The Purana states that Lord Surapadma, revered as the demon king conquered the world and spread Adharma  (non-righteousness). As a result Lord Murugan, the son of Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvathi, led the Devas in a conflict with the forces of evil in order to prevent chaos from spreading over the earth. Surapadma was killed during this terrible conflict, which lasted six days and was brought about by Lord Murugan's supernatural spear (Vel). Consequently, this event has earned the appellation \"Soorasamharam\" in the Hindu culture. The celebrations held on this day honour this heavenly triumph and disseminate the idea that virtue will ultimately triumph over evil. Every year lakhs of devotees throng this temple to celebrate this spiritual occasion. The temple also organises poojas, homams and abishegams to commemorate the festival. On the final day of the festival, the “Utsava Moorthy”(procession deity)is carried around the temple with millions of devotees parading along the procession.",

Lohri is derived from the word “Loi”, who was the wife of kabir Ji, who is said to be the great saint. While some people believe that it originated from the word “Loh” which is a device used for making chapattis. In some parts of the state, people also believe that the festival’s name originated from the name of the sister of “Holika”, who survived the fire while Holika herself died. Besides that, some people also believe that that the word Lohri originated from the word “tilorhi” which comes from the combination of the words rorhi and til. This festival is celebrated as the harvest festival and on this day people light bonfire, sing and dance in joy to pay respect to the Dulha Batti.Lohri in Jammu is special because of various additional traditions associated with it like Chajja-making and dancing, Hiran dance, preparing Lohri garlands. Young children prepare a replica of peacock which is known as Chajja. They carry this Chajja and then go from one house to other house celebrating Lohri. In and around Jammu, special Hiran dance is performed. Selected houses which have auspicious ceremonies prepare eatables. Children wear special garlands made of groundnuts, dry fruits and candies on Lohri day.\\nThis year Lohri Festival celebration by Directorate of Tourism, Jammu shall include performances depicting local folk dances, local folklore and local songs through Jammu and Kashmir  Academy of Art and Culture languages,  Dogra Food Cuisines, Departmental stalls of Handicrafts, Handlooms etc. and has been organized to showcase and celebrate the rich traditional and cultural value of the Jammu Region.",

    "description": "Festivals in Konaseema are different. The festivals held here every year have a special feature Especially Prabhala Tirtha. Kanuvindu Utsava is held for three days by passing Prabhas across the ponds and moving forward as pota competition. It is said that these festivals are being held for over 400 years. Villagers compete by displaying huge prabhas with mela talas. Prabhala Utsavam can be said to be special as tourists come from all over the state to witness the Prabhala Jatara. Another peculiarity here is that Gangalakurru and Gangalakurru Agraharam Rudraprabhas have to cross Godavari Paya and Kaushika in between to reach this garden. Two eyes are not enough to see the courage of those villagers who bring the Gangalakurr Prabhas from the canal saying \"Harahara\". The scene of Prabha bringing 30 people into the garden from the canal brings tears to the eyes of the viewers and before coming to the canal, those lights have to pass through the paddies. Even if the respective farmers come treading the crops in the fields, they consider it auspicious for the Parameshwara to pass through their fields without bothering them. Apart from Konaseema people settled all over the world, people from different parts of the country and abroad come and visit this festival. It is customary for many people to come to these festivals in traditional attire, on bullock carts covered with green coconut mats. The sight of young people who have settled in foreign countries reaching here on Kanuma day and carrying Prabha themselves is a sight to behold. As these Ekadasa Rudras meet here once a year, this garden has gained special importance. It is the measure of Ekadasarudru. According to Hindu Dharma Shastras, Ekadasharudras are found in one place in the whole world, this whole earth is one place. It is in Konaseema, which is like Vedasema. Loka Kalyanardham It is said that the Shivas of these eleven villages meet in Jaggannatota.",

Since time immemorial, Fairs and Festivals celebrated in temples have great influence on the spiritual and cultural life of Indian society. One such festival is Paruveta utsavam celebrated in Ahobilam ,Nandyal district Andhra Pradesh. Ahobilam Paruveta utsavam is unique of its kind as such festival is not celebrated in any other part of our Bharath. It is a grand festival that lasts for about 40 to 45 days as a part of which the main deities of Ahobilam –Shri Prahladavarada Swamy and Jwala Narasimha swamy are taken in procession to about 32 villages. The paruveta utsavam starts on the Makarasankranthi.Shri Jwala Narasim ha swamy is taken down to Lower Ahobilam from Upper Ahobilam on the day of Makarasankranthi.On the next day i.e., the Kanuma day-both the deities start their Paruveta.  Legend is that Paruveta utsavam was started by Sri Aan Satagopa Yatheendra Mahadesikan,the founder of Sri Ahobila math around 630 years ago as per the ine commond.The lines-grame grame cha gathva pada charanayo maam gruhithwa-supports the legend.There is a belief among the devotees particularly,Chenchus,the local tribe that Lord Narasimha swamy is going to each and every village to invite devotees for his marriage  with Chenchu Lakshmi. It starts On the day of Kanuma The deities are seated in a separate manatapa.Special offerings are made to the lord. GUDIKATTU and AYAKATTU , special honours to certain people are given as per the age old tradition. Then the deities are seated in a Pallaki(Palanquin) and the procession starts. At the entrance of temple, Chenchus shoot arrows at the pallaki indicating that the Pallaki is under the protection of Chenchus. The procession proceeds towards Bachepalli.",

It is held over two days, on the 28th and 29th days of the 12th month of the Tibetan Lunar calendar, usually in February. The festival marks the triumph of good over evil, calling upon the gods for their blessings and protection for the approaching year.Several monasteries in Ladakh send their monks to take part in the festival, from making the ritual torma (stor-ma) to performing masked dances and playing sacred instruments. At the centre of the celebrations is a large, colourful and intricate thread cross called ‘dosmo chenmo’ ('literally ‘large thread cross’), from which the festival acquires its name. Made by monks from Takthog Monastery, it is said that evil spirits get entangled in the complex web of this thread and later perish in the fire when the thread is burnt at the end of the second day of the festival. The festival is held in a courtyard (cham ra) below Leh Palace next to the Gompa Soma Monastery.",

    "description": "< style\"text-align: justify;\">Sahibzada Ajit Singh Ji (1687–1705) was the eldest of Guru Gobind Singh's four sons. His younger brothers were Sahibzada Jujhar Singh, Sahibzada Zorawar Singh and Sahibzada Fateh Singh. With his three brothers, Sahibzada Ajit Singh Ji carried on a family tradition: that of attaining the status of one of the most hallowed martyrs in Sikh history. Before him and his brothers, their grandfather, the Ninth Sikh Guru Ji, Guru Tegh Bahadur and his great-great grandfather, the Fifth Sikh Guru Ji, Guru Arjan Dev had also been executed by the Mughals.Early-life\\nSahibzada Ajit Singh Ji was born to Mata Sundari and Guru Gobind Singh Ji at Paonta Sahib on 26 January 1687. The following year, Guru Gobind Singh Ji returned with the family to Anandpur where Sahibzada Ajit Singh Ji was brought up in the approved Sikh style. He was taught religious texts, philosophy and history, and had training in the manly arts such as riding, swordsmanship and archery. He grew up into a handsome young man; strong, intelligent and a natural leader of men.\\nBattles the Ranghars of Nuh\\nSoon after the creation of the Khalsa on 13 April 1699, he had his first test of skill. A Sikh Congregation ('Sangat') coming from the Pothohar region of northwest Punjab, was attacked and looted on the way by the Ranghars (a Muslim tribe) of Nuh, a short distance from Anandpur across the River Satluj. Guru Gobind Singh Ji sent Sahibzada Ajit Singh Ji, then barely 12 years old, to that village. Sahibzada Ajit Singh Ji along with a 100 men reached the spot on 23 May 1699, punished the Ranghars and recovered the looted property.\\nTaragarh and Nirmohgarh\\nA harder task was entrusted to Sahibzada Ajit the following year when the hill chiefs supported by imperial Mughal troops from Lahore and Sirhind attacked Anandpur. Sahibzada Ajit Singh was made responsible for the defence of the Taragarh Fort, which became the first target of attack on 29 August 1700. Ajit Singh, assisted by Bhai Udai Singh, a seasoned soldier, repulsed the attack. He also fought valiantly in the battle of Nirmohgarh in October 1700. On 15 March 1701, a Sikh Sangat coming from the Darap area (near Sialkot) was waylaid by Gujjars and Ranghars. Sahibzada Ajit Singh led a successful expedition against them.",

    "description": "If you want to experience one of the largest tribal gatherings in the world where more than 10 million people converge, you must visit the Sammakka Saralamma Jathara in the remote forest area of Medaram located in the Mulugu district of Telangana, India.\\n\\nThe Sammakka Saralamma Jathara is also known as Medaram Jathara and is dedicated to the tribal Goddesses Sammakka and Saralamma. The Jathara or fair takes place biennially in Medaram which is located about 90 kilometres from the city of Warangal. Tribals from across India participate in the 4-day fair. They come from the states of Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Jharkhand.\\n\\nThe atmosphere at the Sammakka Saralamma Jathara is surcharged with the tremendous faith and devotion of the tribals. It may be noted that all the rites and rituals of the fair are conducted purely according to tribal customs.\\n\\nThe legend of Sammakka and Saralamma, a mother-daughter duo who are worshipped as forms of Adi Parashakti, the primordial Goddess, comes alive with the celebration of Sammakka Saralamma Jathara.\\n\\nA tribal legend presents the fascinating story of Sammakka and Saralamma (Sarakka), and how they became deified in tribal culture. According to this legend, when some tribals were roaming in the forest in quest of prey for their hunt, they chanced upon an infant girl. The girl, apparently a newborn baby, was bathed in a strange halo of light and was playing with tigers. The tribals, stunned at what they saw, took the baby girl to their chieftain, who decided to adopt and bring her up.\\n\\nThe girl was named Sammakka and was brought up as befitting a tribal leader. In course of time, she was married to Pagididda Raju, a chieftain of the Koya tribe. The couple was blessed with three children, daughters Sarakka and Nagulamma, and a son named Jampanna.\\n\\nThose were the times when the Kakatiya dynasty ruled the region from Warangal. Prataprudra, a Kakatiya king imposed a heavy tax on the Koyas, which they could not pay. This led to the Kakatiya king declaring war on the Koya tribe. In the ensuing battle, Sammakka’s husband Pagididda Raju was killed. Sammakka along with her daughter Saralamma, son Jampanna, as well as son-in-law Govinda Raju, entered the fray and fought valiantly, almost turning the tables on the powerful Kakatiya forces. However, Saralamma died fighting valiantly, and Jampanna who was fatally injured fell bleeding into a stream then known as Sampangi Vaagu. Legend has it that the waters of the stream turned red in colour from the blood of Jampanna. The stream was later named Jampanna Vagu as a tribute to the fallen tribal warrior.",

    "description": "Ladakh’s Stok Guru Tsechu Festival is celebrated in the village of Stok, a short distance from Leh, in the first month of the Tibetan lunar calendar. The dates vary every year in accordance with Guru Padmasambhava’s birthday. It is believed that seven oracles inhabit Ladakh, two of which manifest themselves through chosen ones in Stok each year. The chosen oracles undergo a severe month-long retreat where they are prohibited from eating meat. On the day of the festival, the oracles go into a trance and dance along the rooftops of the monastery in flowing white costumes. The villagers bow their heads in prayer, offer Chang (locally brewed rice beer) and Tsampa (roasted barley flour), and await the predictions for the year ahead. This is not like most festivals in India, photography is restricted and it is a rare privilege to witness this ancient tradition and learn of the rise of Buddhism through the vanquishing of demons in the Ladakh valley.",

It is a five-century-old ritual that involves two oracles, known as Rongtsans. The Rongtsans employ ordained monks as their medium. They meditate at least two months in isolation to make themselves conducive for the oracles to transcend in. They perform astounding supernatural feats such as running on the roof parapets of the monastery with steep drops of the mountain on which it’s perched, jumping on the corners of the tall monastery walls, cutting themselves with swords and so on. The next day, they display such unbelievable acts completely blindfold.",

Guru Ravidas was one of the first people to argue that all Indians should have a set of basic human rights. He became an eminent figure in the Bhakti Movement and taught spirituality and tried to bring forward a message of equality message based on freedom from the oppression of the Indian caste system.41 of his devotional songs and poems are included in the Sikh Scriptures, Guru Granth Sahib. Meera bai, a revered figure in Hindu spiritualism is said to have considered Guru Ravidas as her spiritual Guru. The Guru's teachings now form the basis of the Ravidassia religion. Ravidassias believe that Guru Ravidas should be treated as a saint just like the other gurus, as he lived before the first Sikh Guru and his teachings were studied by the Sikh Gurus. In recent years, this has caused conflict with Sikhs and had led to Ravidassia breaking away from the orthodox Sikh structure.",

    "description": "Elaborate Arrangements for Shivaratri Brahmotsavam in Srisailam Temple authorities preparing for 11-day Maha Sivaratri Bramotsavam from March 1st  The Maha Shivaratri Brahmotsavam is celebrated in the month of Magha and spans 11 days with Navahnika Deeksha. Dhwajaarohanam is a significant event at the start of Brahmotsavam, symbolizing the invitation to all gods and goddesses. \\nThe Sri Bhramaramba Sametha Mallikarjuna Swamy temple in Srisailam is readying for the 11-day Maha Shivaratri Bramotsavam from \\nMarch 1st . Special attention is being given to the arrangements for the Padayatra devotees, who trek through the Nallamala forest to reach the temple town by foot. The significant events of the Brahmotsavam, Pagaalankarana and Kalyanotsavam of the Swamy and Ammavaru will be performed on March 10. As many as 200 temporary rest sheds and tents have been set up along the open spaces, accommodating at least 3,000 people in each shed. All sheds are facilitated with a locker system for the convenience of the devotees. Three queue lines have been organised: one for free darshan, another for Siva Deeksha devotees, and a third one for special darshan at a cost of Rs.200 or Rs.500 per head. Around 40 lakh Laddus have also been prepared for distribution. Cultural events are scheduled every day from early morning to late at night during the 11-day Bramostavam. \\nOn March 1st , the festival will commence with Yagashala Pravesham, Siva Sankalpam, Ganapathi Puja in the morning and Dhwajarohana in the evening. The Maha Shivaratri, Lingodbhavakalam, Mahabhisekham, Pagalankarana and Kalyanotsaham will be observed on March 8th . On March 9th , the Rathotsavam and Theppotsavam would take place, followed by the Dwajarohanam on March 10th  and Pushpotsavam and Shayanolsavam the next day. March 5. The Maha Shivaratri Brahmotsavam is celebrated in the month of Magha and spans 11 days with Navahnika Deeksha. Dhwajaarohanam is a significant event at the start of Brahmotsavam, symbolizing the invitation to all gods and goddesses. \\nThe Lingodbhavakala Abhishekam at midnight during Maha Shivaratri is a major ritual. The unique custom of Pagaalankarana is observed in the temple, where a weaver decorates a lengthy new white cloth called Paagaa in total darkness, starting from the Sikhara of the Swamy’s Vimana Gopuram and passing around the Nandi idols placed on the Mukha Mandapam. An intriguing aspect is that the weaver decorates the Paagaa in total darkness and all the lights in the temple are turned off during this time. The cloth used in the Pagalankarana is hand-woven by weavers in a special effort throughout the year. Usually, around 30 Paagaas are offered by weavers inidually as a vow and all the Paagaas are decorated simultaneously by a single weaver. After Pagalankarana, the Kalyanotsavam is performed.",

    "description": "The Bugga Ramalingeswara Swamy Temple, situated on the southern bank of the Penna River in Tadipatri, Anantapur district of Andhra Pradesh, holds a special place in the hearts of devotees. As per the Tadipatri Kaifiyat collected by Colin Mackenzie in 1802, The temple was built between 1490 and 1509 by Ramalinga Nayudu, a chieftain of the Gutti-Gandikota region during the reign of the illustrious Vijayanagara Empire, the temple stands as a testament to the rich cultural and architectural heritage of the region.\\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\\n                            \\nDedicated to Lord Shiva in the form of Ramalingeswara Swamy, the temple exudes architectural splendor with its unique blend of Chalukyan, Chola, and Vijayanagar art styles. One of its distinctive features is the presence of unfinished gopurams, which, despite being incomplete, boast intricate sculptures and carvings that leave visitors in awe.\\nAs devotees enter the temple premises, they are greeted by the sight of the Shiva Purana and scenes from Hindu epics like the Ramayana and Mahabharata adorning the walls in exquisite miniature carvings. The main sanctum houses the swayambhu linga, a naturally occurring symbol of Lord Shiva, which continuously emits holy water, believed to bestow ine blessings upon those who partake in it.\\nAdjacent to the temple, on the banks of the Penna River, stands a statue of a goddess. Legend has it that when the water level of the river reaches the navel point of the goddess statue, it foretells the submergence of the entire town of Tadipatri—a belief steeped in local folklore and spirituality.\\nThe temple hosts an annual celebration known as Bramhotsavam, which is a testament to the enduring devotion of the devotees. Scheduled to take place from March 3rd to March 13th in 2024, the Bramhotsavam promises a spiritual extravaganza filled with elaborate rituals and colourful processions.",

    "description": "Thimmamma Marrimanu, located in Gootibylu village, stands as a natural wonder and a testament to the awe-inspiring resilience of nature. This banyan tree, a towering symbol of vitality and endurance, was accorded the prestigious honor of being listed in the Guinness Book of World Records in 1989, with its entry updated in 2017. Renowned for its colossal size and age, Thimmamma Marrimanu boasts a remarkable legacy, being documented as 550 years old at the time of its recognition. Its claim to fame lies in its unparalleled perimeter length, spreading majestically over five acres with a circumference measuring an astounding 846 meters.\\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\\n                            Thimmamma Marrimanu, stands not only as a natural wonder but also as a profound symbol of spiritual reverence and local folklore. With its sprawling canopy extending over five acres and adorned with over 6686 roots, Thimmamma Marrimanu epitomizes the grandeur and mystique of the banyan tree species. Unlike most trees, the banyan grows from the top down, with seeds allowing tendrils to descend to the ground and expand its reach. These prop roots, characteristic of the banyan, give rise to the illusion of an entire forest encapsulated within a singular tree, a spectacle that has captivated generations of visitors and pilgrims.\\nBeyond its botanical marvel, Thimmamma Marrimanu is steeped in local legends and Hindu beliefs, intertwining myth with the tangible presence of nature. The legend of Thimmamma, a devoted wife who immolated herself on her husband's funeral pyre in the 15th century, is deeply intertwined with the tree's lore. Locals believe that her spirit resides within the tree, infusing it with an aura of eternal love and sacrifice. Moreover, Hindu mythology venerates the banyan tree as Trimurthya, embodying the ine presence of Lord Vishnu, Lord Brahma, and Lord Shiva within its bark, roots, and branches, respectively. Such beliefs lend Thimmamma Marrimanu an aura of sanctity and reverence, drawing pilgrims and devotees from far and wide to seek blessings and solace beneath its majestic canopy.\\nThe annual Thimmamma Jatara, observed with great fervor during Sivarathri, serves as a vibrant testament to the tree's significance in local culture and spirituality. During the three-day festival, pilgrims from across Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, and Tamilnadu converge upon the sacred grounds, partaking in rituals and ceremonies that honor Hindu deities and celebrate the enduring legacy of Thimmamma. Amidst the festivities, the tree becomes a focal point of communal devotion and celebration, offering pilgrims a respite from the mundane and a glimpse into the realm of the ine. As chants of holy mantras resonate amidst the rustling leaves, and devotees seek solace in the shade of its ancient branches, Thimmamma Marrimanu stands as a living testament to the enduring power of faith, folklore, and the mystical allure of the banyan tree.",

    "description": "One such popular fair which is celebrated yearly on the eve of Maha Shivratri and visited by lakhs of devotees mainly from the Telugu speaking states of Telangana & Andhra Pradesh is the Kotappakonda Tirunalla Fair.Kotappakonda is a holy hill, situated in Palnadu district, Andhra Pradesh, India. It is located 20 kilometers from Narasaraopet and Chilakaluripet city and 62 kilometers south west of Guntur City. Celebrated with great devotion and fervor every year with a large number of devotees thronging the place. Kotappa Konda hill appears with 3 peaks in any direction so it's also called as Trikutadri, Trikuta Parvatham. The three hills are Brahma hill, Vishnu hill and Rudra hill. These 3 hills can be distinctly seen from a distance from any direction.\\nBrahma Shikharam: The main temple Trikoteswara Swamy Temple is located here.\\nRudra Shikharam: Old Kotayya temple is located here. This is the first place where Trikoteswara Swamy existed, seeing the great devotion of Devotee Gollabhama, Trikoteswara Swamy came to Brahma Shikharam. Hence it is called Paatha (old) Kotayya Temple. Lord Paapanaseswara Temple is here. It is believed that Lord Vishnu did penance for Lord Shiva. There is also a holy pond \"Paapanasa Teertha\" here.Sundudu, a cattleman, with his wife Kundiri used to live towards the south of the Trikuta hills. They became rich soon after the birth of their first child, a beautiful daughter, Anandavalli(Gollabhama). Slowly she became a great devotee of Lord Shiva and started spending most of her time offering prayers to Lord Shiva at the Old Koteswara Temple located on Rudra hill.She used to visit Rudra hill every day, even during the scorching summer, to offer prayers to the Lord. Pleased with her penance, Jangama Devara appeared before her. Sympathized by her penance, Jangama Devara blessed her to be a pregnant, though she was a spinster. Unmindful of her pregnancy she carried her daily prayers as usual. From Rudra hill, Anandavalli proceeded towards her home and after reaching Brahma hill, she lost her patience and turned back. The moment she turned back, breaking the promise she made, Lord Jangama Devara immediately stopped where he was, at Brahma hills and entered into a cave on that hill and turned himself into a Lingam. This sacred placed is famous by the name New Koteswara Temple.",

The first festival is held at Shey Palace on the 26th and 27th day of the first month of the Tibetan calendar corresponding to July or August month of the Gregorian calendar. This festival is called \"Shey Doo Lhoo\" to mark the beginning of the sowing season. The two day monastic celebration is marked by special rituals performed by the monks in the main monastery, in addition to several other religious rites. Villagers throng to the monastery in large numbers in a spirit of celebration and hope.

According to Pancharatra Agama sastra, Brahma celebrates Brahmothsavam for the well-being of People. Sage Vyasa gives a detailed account on Ahobilam Brahmothsavam in Ahobila Kshetra Mahatmyam of Brahmanda Purana.During Brahmothsavam Lord Narasimha Swamy will be taken in Procession on different Vahanas(Vehicles). On the first day of Brahmothsavam , Dhwaja Rohanam is performed, a ritual to invite all Devas (Gods) to the abode. A special ritual – BHERI THADANAM (Playing drums) is performed by Archakas in order to invite all Devas as a part of which respective Raga, Thala and Nrtya are played and performed in front of the deity. The unique practice of Ahobilam Brahmothsavam is that Garuda Seva is performed on the final day of Brahmothsavam unlike other Vaishnava temples. On the seventh day of Brahmothsavam Kalyanothsavam is celebrated to Goddess Maha Lakshmi and Narasimha Swamy. On the ninth day of the festival marks the celebration of Rathothsavam (Chariot festival)\\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\\n                            Ahobilam Brahmothsavm is Celebrated every year from Phalguna Suddha Panchami to Pournami (corresponding to 15-03-2024 to 25-03-2024 in Upper Ahobilam this year) after the completion of Paruveta Utsavam, a grand unique festival that is celebrated for 45 days as a part of which the deity is taken in procession to 32 Villages.

Srikurmam is a famous temple dedicated to Lord Vishnu in his Kurma (tortoise) avatar, located in Andhra Pradesh, India.The temple is built several centuries ago by Kalinga kings and is in very good condition.An annual car festival is conducted every year and thousands throng the place from all over India.The festival is conducted just before Telugu new year Ugadi on Dola Pournami.There is well carved black stone carving to the back entrance to the temple compound. During the Dola Utsav in Srikurmam temple, there might be special rituals and festivities organized to celebrate the occasion. These could include elaborate processions of the deity's idol, devotional singing, traditional dances, and offerings made by devotees. Since temple festivals often have unique traditions and customs specific to the local culture and religious practices, the Dola Utsav at Srikurmam temple would likely have its own distinct characteristics and significance within the context of the temple's worship.",

    "description": "Malayattoor has a pilgrimage festival.  Devotees climb the hill without any celebration, after leading an austere life of prayer. The Feast day falls on the Sunday after the resurrection of Christ (Easter). Since His disciples did not see him after resurrection, St. Thomas did not believe it. But the Lord appeared on the eighth day, blessed St.Thomas and cleared his doubts. This day is known as New Sunday. Devotees ascend the hills with chanting. \\n\\nAnother Feast being observed by the Christians in Kerala is Dukram. This Feast, observed on July 3, is a reminder of the martyrdom of St. Thomas. Devotees go to Mylapore for Dukram Feast. December 18 is observed as Kurissu Viyartha Feast of St. Thomas. This is observed in connection with the stone cross of Mylapore. The diocese church stands on the banks of river Periyar. This is also known as Thazhathu. Ascending of the hills begin from the valley. A statue of St. Thomas is there at the place where the pilgrimage begins.",

This girl is honoured to be the “Devi”(Goddess) in the celebration. During this festival, the girl is adorned with silk sarees and aromatic flower garlands. The “Penn Nila” is offered with milk, sweets, flowers and glass bangles. The devotees believe that, if the “Devi” is well-treated during this festival, it brings them the hope to a good harvest and rainfall in the upcoming year. During this festival, tribal devotees perform a unique tribal dance and celebrate the “Devi” by chanting and singing songs. A significant number of foreign tourists also visit this village to witness this unique festival. Apart from this, a large number of devotees from nearby villages and districts gather at the temple to commemorate the celebration.",

Every year, the church hosts an annual fest for the “Blessed Virgin Mary” in the month of January for 10 days. History and SignificanceThis shrine's history can be traced to the 17th century, when an Italian missionary named Fr. Beshi brought two statues of Mother Mary to Elakurichi (Thirukavalur),where one of which got misplaced. It is believed that one day Mother Mary appeared in the dreams of Kachirayar and his wife, to find her missing statue in the forest and build a chapel at that place. When Kachirayar found the holy statue and built a chapel, Mother Mary bestowed her blessings and gave the couple a child boon. Devotees of this shrine believe that offering prayers to the Almighty, safeguards them from the evil.The annual fest is organised in the month of January, commencing with the hoisting of a holy flag.",

In some form or the other, it is celebrated all over Rajasthan. “Gan” is a synonym for Lord Shiva & “Gauri” or “Gaur” stands for Goddess Parvati, the heavenly consort of Lord Shiva. Gangaur celebrates the union of the two and is a symbol of conjugal & marital happiness. Gangaur is celebrated in the month of Chaitra (March-April), the first month of the Hindu calendar. This month marks the end of winter & the onset of spring. This festival is celebrated especially by women, who worship clay idols of “Gan” & “Gauri” in their houses. These idols are worshipped by unmarried girls who seek the blessings of Gan & Gauri for a good husband, while the married women pray for the good health and long life of their husbands. This worship which starts from the first day of the chaitra month culminates on the 18th day into Gangaur festival with a great religious fervor. On the eve of Gangaur festival, women decorate their palms and fingers with henna. The idols of Gan and Gauri are immersed in a pond or in a nearby lake on the last day of the festival. A traditional procession of Gangaur commences form the Zanani-Deodhi of the City Palace, passing through Tripolia Bazaar, Chhoti Chaupar, Gangauri Bazaar, Chaugan stadium and finally converges near the Talkatora. The procession is headed by a colorful pageantry of old palanquins, chariots, bullock carts and performing folk artists.",

    "description": "Gangaur is one of the most important festivals in Rajasthan. In some form or the other, it is celebrated all over Rajasthan. “Gan” is a synonym for Lord Shiva & “Gauri” or “Gaur” stands for Goddess Parvati, the heavenly consort of Lord Shiva. Gangaur celebrates the union of the two and is a symbol of conjugal & marital happiness. Gangaur is celebrated in the month of Chaitra (March-April), the first month of the Hindu calendar. This month marks the end of winter & the onset of spring. This festival is celebrated especially by women, who worship clay idols of “Gan” & “Gauri” in their houses. These idols are worshipped by unmarried girls who seek the blessings of Gan & Gauri for a good husband, while the married women pray for the good health and long life of their husbands. This worship which starts from the first day of the chaitra month culminates on the 18th day into Gangaur festival with a great religious fervor. On the eve of Gangaur festival, women decorate their palms and fingers with henna. The idols of Gan and Gauri are immersed in a pond or in a nearby lake on the last day of the festival. A traditional procession of Gangaur commences form the Zanani-Deodhi of the City Palace, passing through Tripolia Bazaar, Chhoti Chaupar, Gangauri Bazaar, Chaugan stadium and finally converges near the Talkatora. The procession is headed by a colorful pageantry of old palanquins, chariots, bullock carts and performing folk artists.",

    "description": "What makes Baisakhi so special, is that it marks the first day of the new year according to the Sikh calendar. Another amazing root to this festival is that Baisakhi was one of the three main festivals that the third Sikh Guru, Guru Amar Das ji chose to celebrate. On the day of Baisakhi, in the year 1699, the tenth Sikh Guru, Sri Guru Gobind Singh Ji established the Khalsa Panth.\\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\\n                            Baisakhi is also the time when farmers begin harvesting of the Rabi crops. It is a significant event for the farmers in the region and observed as a thanksgiving to the Gods and the natural elements. Waking up to the beautiful Baisakhi day morning is like stepping up on a fortune as one can see Punjab at its happiest and most joyful self-preparation for the festival. It begins well in advance and Gurudwaras are decorated, men prepare and practice for their Martial Arts. In this period of celebrations, artisans from across the State and country come to sell their Handicrafts all over Punjab. The purpose of Baisakhi celebrations is to come together with the feeling of oneness and joy. On this day men, women and children dress up in their favorite traditional attire. Punjabis been outstanding hosts, one can book a Farm stay or a Homestay and celebrate it with the locals. Punjab tourism offers various options which can be chosen for a perfect stay. If you happen to be in Amritsar, you can have Kada Prasad and Guru ka Langar at the Golden Temple. Spectate the Nagar Kirtan and the prowess of the Lions of Punjab.

    "description": "One of the most memorable event of Shri Krishna’s life which embarks him as God of love is his marriage to devi Rukmani. Krishna’s wife Rukmani was daughter of legendary King Bhishmak who ruled his kingdom ‘Vidarbha’ (today’s Arunachal Pradesh). Rukmani was deeply in love with Krishna and was determined to marry him. But her brother loaded with disgust towards Krishna, forced her to get married to Shishupal. Rukmani opposed but when her father too agreed and supported her brother’s decision, she wrote a letter to Krishna to save her from the situation and declared a fast up to death if he didn’t come. That letter is referred as first love letter in the history of Love. On the day of her marriage with Shishupal in the presence of hundreds of kings, Krishna with help of his brother Balram takes  Rukmani from Vidarba and marries. devi Rukmani at Madhavpur on the seashore near Dwarika, close to Porbandar (in today’s time). This immortal event of love gets celebrated as a festival at Madhavpur in the memory Shri Krishna, devi Rukmani, and the journey they undertook to reach to Gujarat from Arunachal Pradesh. This annual fair is a five day long event organized at Madhavpur village starting on the day of ‘Ram Navami’. A colourful chariot is adorned with an idol of Krishna placed in it, which circumnavigates the village with full of joy and festivity. People celebrates this event with colours and dance. The best part of this fair is that, that with the passage of time and with the efforts of the people it keeps evolving. Without compromising on traditional and religious importance of the same, it also blends cultures of eastern and western parts of India now. Such amalgamation sets the true example of 'Ek Bharat Shrestha Bharat' for other parts of the country as well.  Exhibition and sale of art and crafts of Gujarat and handloom, handicrafts products from Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur and other North-Eastern states remains the favourite part of the event. Visual Art Exhibition on Krishna and Rukmani put together by different institutions of Ministry of Culture has also been one of the main attractions of the visitor of this fair. Every year lots of new and contemporary ideas are added to this week long fair keeping the Krishna-Rukmani as centre of this amazing event. Why it is must to visit this Fair: This week long fair is a rare combination where two different regions unite and exchange culture and art in addition to love. This fair celebrates 'Ek Bharat Shrestha Bharat' in true sense. Exchanging energy with lots of Krishna lovers and Krishna believers gathered in one place is definitely once in a life time experience. This also introduces the art, culture, dance and music of two regions in place at the same time; the idea itself is so enticing, that it invites any soul on this land of ‘Madhav’ to be part of this fair.",

If you are a devotee of Shri Ram then you can go to this special temple of Punjab on Ram Navami. The connection of this temple is with Lord Shri Ram.Ram Tirath Temple, Amritsar dates back to the Ramayana Period. There was a time when Mata Sita was abandoned after she came from Lanka. Shri Ram Tirth is the place where she got shelter in the ashram of sage Shri Valmiki. It is the same place where she gave birth to the twins, Luv and Kush. The fight between the twins and Lord Ram’s army took place here at Shri Ram Tirth Temple. The entire epic of Ramayana was composed in this ashram by Valmiki. You will feel the presence of Lord Ram in Shri Ram Teerth Temple located in Amritsar, Punjab. This temple is an important pilgrimage site for Hindus. A series of such significant incidents make Shri Ram Tirth Temple one of the most sacred Ram temples in India. The entire complex has a number of temples, which exhibit scenes from Ramayana.",

    "description": "In 1704 Anandpur was under an extended siege by the allied forces of the Mughals and the hill chiefs. Provisions were completely exhausted and the Khalsa lived on leaves and the bark of trees. The Jats of Majha made up their mind to go home. The Guru would not let them leave unless they signed a disclaimer saying that they were no longer the Sikhs of Sri Guru Gobind Singh Ji. Out of hundreds of Sikhs, only forty put their thumb impression on the disclaimer; they were then permitted to leave Anandpur. This was during the siege of Sri Anandpur Sahib, which lasted eight months long, resulting in about 10,000 Sikh Soldiers under the 10th Master, Sri Guru Gobind Singh Ji giving a devasting defeat to the one million mughals who had invaded the holy city. Each of the Hill Rajas, except about three groups were fighting along side the Mughal Imperial Army.\\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\\n                            \\nThe forty deserters from Anandpur lived in the Majha region in the district of Amritsar. In one of their villages, called Jhabal, there lived a brave woman named Mai Bhago. She was known for her faith and courage, and she had a great zeal to serve the Guru. Her blood boiled at the timidity of those who, beaten by the ravages of the prolonged siege of Anandpur, disclaimed Sri Guru Gobind Singh Ji to return to their homes. She was smitten at the ignominy shown by these forty deserters. Mai Bhago charged them with cowardice and lack of faith. She was determined to wipe out this stain of infamy on Majha Singhs.\\nShe went around the neighbouring villages and exhorted the women folk not to be hospitable to the deserters who had disclaimed the Guru. She shamed and censured the Singhs for their cowardice and eventually brought them back to the path of devotion and sacrifice. She, donning a man’s dress, inspired them to return to the fold of Sri Guru Gobind Singh Ji. Feeling ashamed for their act of cowardice, they followed her banner and joined in the famous battle of Sri Muktsar Sahib, which was fought against the Mughal forces at Khidrana in the district of Ferozepur.\\nMai Bhago vowed to suffer death on the blood-stained battlefield on behalf of the Guru. She fought so well in their ranks that she disposed of several Muslim soldiers. The “Chali Mukte” led by the great female general Mai Bhago had brought such damage onto the Mughal force of 10 000 strong, they had no option but to retreat. This battle can be found inside the British War History Wonders. At the end of the battle, when Sri Guru Gobind Singh Ji was looking for survivors, Mai Bhago, who was lying wounded, greeted him. She told him how the forty deserters had valiantly laid down their lives fighting in the battlefield. Guru Saheb was greatly touched by her sense of remorse, self-sacrifice, and heroism. Mai Bhago recovered and remained in the Guru’s presence after the battle of Sri Muktsar Sahib.",

    "description": "It is one of the important festivals in Hinduism as it is the birth anniversary of the sixth avatar of Vishnu. Lord Parshuram Jayanti is celebrated when Tritiya prevails during Pradosh Kaal since it is that Lord Parshurama was born during that period. This avatar came into existence to terminate destructive and sinful monarchs that burdened the Earth. Hence, worshipping God on this auspic day will prove to be beneficial. A lot of devotees take bath in the holy Ganga river on Parshu Jayanti as it is considered to be a sacred ritual to be performed on such religious festivals.It is believed that Lord Vishnu incarnated as Parshurama in human form to destroy the evil on this planet. He was born to sage Jamadagni and his wife Renuka after performing the Putreshti Yajna. He had the qualities of a Kshatriya even after being a Brahmin. This was because of his father(Jamadagni) who possessed the qualities of a Kshatriya since Jamadagni's mother Satyavati had committed a mistake before his birth which resulted in Jamadagni being born with the ability of a Kshatriya. Lord Parshuram is said to carry various traits including courage, aggression, and warfare along with patience and prudence. There have been mentions of Parshurama in various Hindu texts as Rama Jamadagnya, Rama Bhargava, and Veera Drama.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\\n                            He appeared on the Earth when the evil was dominant and the Kshatriya class had begun to intimidate others. Parshurama is one of the seven Chiranjeevi's (immortal beings) that are Lord Hanuman, Kripacharya, Mahabali, Ashwathama, Lord Parshurama, Vibhishana, Vyas. Thus, it is believed that Lord Parshurama is also existing to date to help the 10th incarnation of Lord Vishnu i.e. Kalki as stated in Kalki Purana.",

    "description": "Sri Veera Venkata Satyanarayana Swamy Vari Divya Kalyana Mahostavam, Annavaram Temple, Kakinada District celabrated  Vysakha Shudda Dasami, Saturday from dt. 18-05-2024 to Vysakha Bahula Padyami Friday dt.24-05-2024( every Year for the month of  May 3rd week).          At a distance of 2 km from Annavaram Railway Station, Sri Satyanarayana Swamy Temple is situated on Ratnagiri hill. The Ratnagiri hill is about 300 feet above sea level with lot of greenery around and the Pampa River encircling the hill. About 460 stone steps lead to the temple from the bottom of the hill. It is believed that all the wishes of devotees will be fulfilled when Satyanarayana Vratam is performed here.\\n          This temple was constructed in the Dravidian style in the year of 1891 by Raja Ramanarayana, the then zamindar of Gorsa and Kirlampudi estates. It is said that the Lord came into his dream and ordered the temple construction. He traced the idol on the hill, worshipped it and installed it at the present spot. Subsequently the temple was reconstructed during 1933-34 and during 2011-2012. According to history, Sri Krishnadevaraya of Vijayanagara used the secret underground passages in the hills to attack the enemy during his invasion of Kalinga. Alluri Seetharama Raju used the secret quarters in these hill ranges, when he rebelled against the British Rule.\\n         The main temple was constructed in the form of a chariot with four wheels at each of the four corners. In front of the main temple is the kalyana mantapa, constructed and decorated with modern pieces of architecture. The presiding deity of the temple is Lord Veera Venkata Satyanarayana Swamy. The name of the Goddess is Ananta Lakshmi Satyavathi Devi. According to legend, Meru, the Lord of the hills and his consort Menaka did great penance and got two sons Bhadra and Ratnakara by the grace of Lord Vishnu. Bhadra pleased Lord Vishnu with his devotion and penance, became Bhadrachalam on which Lord Sri Rama had settled. Ratnakara desired to emulate his brother and succeeded in pleasing Lord Vishnu by his penance to settle on him as Veera Venkata Satyanarayana Swamy, Ratnakara subsequently became Ratnagiri hill.\\n        The temple is constructed in two floors; the ground floor contains the yantra and the peetham of the Lord. On the four sides of the yantra there are four deities namely Ganapati, Suryanarayana, Bala Tripurasundari and Maheswara. In the 1st floor the Moola virat of Lord Satyanarayana swamy is placed in the center, the image of Goddess Anantha Lakshmi is situated towards his right side and Lord Shiva on the left. The 13 ft idol of Trimurthis - Brahma, Vishnu and Siva is unique attraction.",

    "description": "Samrat Prithviraj Jayanti samaroh is organised to celebrate birthday of great emperor. Prithviraja III (born c. 1166—died 1192) was a Rajput warrior king of the Chauhan (Chahamana) clan of rulers who established the strongest kingdom in Rajasthan. Prithviraja’s defeat in 1192 in the second battle of Taraori (Tarain) at the hands of the Muslim leader Muʿizz al-Dīn Muḥammad ibn Sām (Muḥammad Ghūrī) marked a watershed in the medieval history of India.\\n\\nAscending the throne about 1177, the young Prithviraja inherited a kingdom that stretched from Sthanvishvara (Thanesar; once the capital of the 7th-century ruler Harsha) in the north to Mewar in the south. Within a few years, Prithviraja had personally assumed control of the administration, but, shortly after taking power, he was faced with a rebellion from his cousin, Nagarjuna, who asserted his own claim to the throne. The revolt was brutally crushed, and Prithviraja turned his attention to the nearby kingdom of the Bhadanakas. The Bhadanakas had been a persistent threat to the Chauhan-held region around Delhi, but they were so comprehensively destroyed sometime prior to 1182 that they ceased to be mentioned in subsequent historical records.",

On December 11 in 2014, the United Nations General Assembly declared June 21st as the International Day of Yoga. The declaration came at the behest of the Indian Prime Minister, Narendra Modi during his address to UN General Assembly on September 27, 2014 wherein he stated: \"Yoga is an invaluable gift of India's ancient tradition. It embodies unity of mind and body; thought and action; restraint and fulfillment; harmony between man and nature; a holistic approach to health and well-being. It is not about exercise but to discover the sense of oneness with yourself, the world and the nature”. In Suggesting June 21, which is the Summer Solstice, as the International Day of Yoga, Narendra Modi had said: \"the date is the longest day of the year in the Northern Hemisphere and has special significance in many parts of the world.”",

The chariot procession of Bastar was started by the rulers of Chalukya dynast and Maharaja Purushottam Dev of Bastar visited Jagannathpuri at Odisha. Raja Purushottam Dev Maharaja offered emeralds to Jagannathpuri and got the title of Rathapati. After being coronated in 1408 and coming back from Puri, Raja Purushottam Dev ordered construction of a chariot of 16 wheels, then gave 4 wheels for the construction of Lord Jagannath’s chariot and constructed a chariot from the wheels left. The second chariot is constructed with 4 wheels. Once 7 chariots were used to move during Dussehra, among which one chariot was of Lord Jagannath. Now 3 chariots take the procession. These rituals add uniqueness to Bastar Dussehra. In Bastar, Asadh shukl dutiya with Lord Jagannath, Balbhadra and Subhadradevi the rathyatra started and ended in the Asadh shukl dashmi . It is a 9 days festival. The festival was started by the Rajparivar and rulers of the Chalukya Dynasty. There is a different tradition of mock tupki in ‘Goncha Festival’ in Jagdalpur. The tradition of mock tupki is not prevalent anywhere expect bastar. The fruit of Goncha is used as a bullet while a gun is made out of bamboo. Everything used is fake and harmless, created just for the sake of fun. The gun made for mockery is called Tupki. Tupki is also made from taad’s leaves, bamboo, chind’s leaves etc is used for making bullet also.",

    "description": "The Athachamayam parade held at Thripunithura in Ernakulam district every year during the month of Chingam marks the beginning of Onam festivities in Kerala. Before independence, the event used to be held at Thripunithura as it was the headquarters of the Maharajas of Cochin state. On this day, the Maharaja of Cochin with his entourage visited his subjects. A parade of folk art forms, musicians and caparisoned elephants was carried out, making it a colourful event. \\n\\nIn 1949, Athachamayam was temporarily stopped for the merging of the Travancore-Cochin kingdoms to form the short-lived Thiru-Kochi state. The parade resumed in all its glory in 1961 when Onam became a mass festival in Kerala. The procession, which used to start from Hill Palace, now starts from Attam Nagar, near the high school ground and ends there.\\n\\nThe royal Athachamayam is preceded by a three-day ritual. The royal town crier arrives in the village on an elephant and beats the drum to get the villagers’ attention, and proceeds to announce the start of the rituals. As a symbol of religious harmony, the Kakkattu temple priest, Nettur Thangal and the priest of Karingachira pay a visit to the king on the day of the parade. The king enters the palanquin to begin the parade after greeting the visitors. He wears vibrant jewels known as ‘veeralipattu’ and the royal crown in gold. After the procession, a lavish sadya is held followed by the awards ceremony to recognise the achievements of outstanding locals. \\n\\nFolk stories abound over the Athachamayam. One among them is related to Thrikkakkara Vamana Moorthi Temple. It is said after the last Cheraman Perumal, the Thrikkakara festival was conducted through the combined efforts of 56 kings. But the festival on the day of Atham was carried out by the king of Kochi and the Samoothiris. According to folk history, the first Athachamayam procession was carried out by the Maharaja of Cochin at Thrikkakara. This custom came to a halt when the Thrikkakara temple was taken over by the king who ruled Edapally.\\n\\nAnother folklore states that the Athachamayam parade was conducted as a remembrance of the revolt that happened when the Maharaja of Cochin tried to capture the land of Vanneri from the Samoothiris. After he lost the battle, the King never wore the crown and used to place the ‘Kulashekhara’ crown on his lap in later processions. Another historical account claims that the king of Kochi displayed his military might in honour of his victory in the Battle of Kochi between Kochi and the Northern region. The Athachamayam parade, which is held every Onam, evokes memories from bygone eras and is a symbol of religious unity.",

Its unique history, the legends that surround it, the types and shapes of boats that participate and the very backdrop of the race is different, making it a special event. It is closely linked to rituals and religious practices of the Aranmula Parthasarathy Temple.\\n\\n\\nThe race is annually held on the day of Uthrittathi in the month of Chingam. It is also the anniversary day that commemorates the dedication of the idol at the Aranmula temple. According to the legend, goddess Bhumi Devi re-dedicated the idol in Aranmula from Nilakkal where ‘Arjuna’ had earlier dedicated it. It is believed that ine presence and blessings will be on the boats that participate in the race on that day. The race also has another mythical story. Lord Sri Krishna appeared in the dream of the Bhattathiri of Kattoor Mangadu Illam and asked him to give a feast to the Aranmula temple on every Thiruvonam day.\\n\\n\\nFrom that year onwards, Bhattathiri would bring the Thiruvonam feast on a boat to the Aranmula temple from Mangadu Illam. Once, the Bhattathiri was attacked by bandits on his way to the temple. The people of the locality came to know about the attack and arrived at the spot on boats to provide protection for Thiruvonathoni and Bhattathiri. Since then, chundan vallams that serve also as battle boats began to accompany the Thiruvonathoni. The water procession that we see today is conducted in remembrance of this event. Later, a boat race also started as a part of this event on the day of Uthrittathi. There are different opinions though, on how old the race is.",

    "description": "Shaheed Baba Deep Singh Ji is one of most honored martyrs of Sikh history. His parents, Bhai Bhagtu Ji and Mata Jeonee Ji, lived in the village of Pahuwind, Amritsar, India. They were hard working Sikh farmers but had not been blessed with any children. A Sikh saint told them one day that they would have a special child whom they should name Deep (meaning one who gives light). Baba Deep Singh Ji was born to them on January 26, 1682 (14 Maagh Sunmat 1739). Since Deep was an only child, his parents raised him with much devotion and affection. At the age of twelve, Baba Deep Singh Ji went with his parents to Anandpur Sahib to meet Guru Gobind Singh Ji, the tenth Sikh guru. They stayed at Anandpur Sahib for several days, doing seva (service) with the Sikh community. When his parents were ready to return to their village, Guru Gobind Singh Ji asked Baba Deep Singh Ji to stay with him. He humbly accepted Guru Ji's command and began serving him. While at Anandpur Sahib, Baba Deep Singh Ji learned about Sikh philosophy and Sri Guru Granth Sahib, the Sikh holy book of ures. He learned gurmukhi (Punjabi ) and several other languages. Guru Gobind Singh Ji also taught him horseback riding, hunting and arms training. At the age of eighteen, he received amrit (holy water) from Guru Ji on Vaisakhi. As a amritdhari Sikh, Baba Deep Singh Ji took an oath to serve as God's soldier - Sikhs are to always help the weak and needy, and to fight for truth and justice. Baba Deep Singh Ji soon became one of Guru Gobind Singh Ji's most beloved Sikhs. Baba Deep Singh Ji stayed in Guru Gobind Singh Ji's service for about eight years. At Guru Ji's request, he returned to his village to help his parents. A year after his return to Pahuwind, a Sikh messenger arrived from Guru Gobind Singh Ji. Baba Deep Singh Ji was told that Guru Ji had left his fort in Anandpur Sahib after fighting with the Hindu hill rajas for six months. He also learned that the Guru's four sons and his mother, Mata Gujri, had all become separated. Upon hearing such disheartening news, Baba Deep Singh Ji immediately left Pahuwind to meet Guru Gobind Singh Ji.",

    "description": "Bhai Mardana (1459-1534), Guru Nanak Dev Ji’s longtime Muslim companion throughout his extensive journeys across the country and abroad, was born as the son of a Mirasi couple, Badra and Lakkho, of Talvandi Rai Bhoe, now Nankana Sahib, in the Sheikhupura district of Pakistan. The Mirasan were a caste of hereditary minstrels and genealogists. Bhai Sahib was ten years older than Guru Ji and was his childhood friend and companion. Guru Nanak Dev Ji and Bhai Mardana were both born and raised in the same village. The Miharban Janam Sakhi describes the latter, who was ten years senior in age, as the Guru's companion since his childhood days and as one who sang to him songs from the Bhagats (Kabir Ji, Trilochan Ji, Ravidas Ji, Dhanna Ji, and Bern Ji). According to Ratan Singh Bhangu, Prachin Panth Prakash, Guru Nanak Dev Ji, as a small boy, gave Bhai Mardana a string instrument improvised from reeds to play on while he sang the hymns. As Guru Nanak was employed to take charge of the granaries and stores of the Nawab of Sultanpur Lodhi, the stories of his generosity and hospitality spread far and wide. Mardana, already a married man and father of two sons and a daughter, wanted to visit Sultanpur and seek his bounty. Meanwhile, he was charged by Guru Nanak's father Mehta Kalu, to go to Sultanpur and bring news of the welfare of his son. Mardana went to Sultanpur, never to part company with Guru Nanak again. His occupation was playing the rabab or rebeck as Guru Nanak recited God's glory. When Guru Nanak prepared to go forth into the world to preach his message, he invited Mardana to accompany him. Mardana hesitated, for he did not wish to leave his family until his daughter had been married off and for this he did not have sufficient means. One of Guru Nanak's disciples, Bhai Bhagirath, bought the needed provisions and Mardana was able to give away his daughter in marriage. He was then ready to accompany Guru Nanak on his travels. To relieve the rigour of the journeys, the biographers have described several humorous situations relating to Mardana's touchy behaviour links with desire for food. It is said that he displayed panicky behaviour when prospects of getting the next meal seemed less than certain. He was not easily convinced when Guru Nanak told him to be patient and have trust in something turning up, and wished always to have a reserve of food ready beforehand so that there was certainty that he would not have to endure hunger. The prospect of being without rations created a major problem for Bhai Mardana - hunger-phobia! As the Puratan Janam Sakhi narrates, Guru Nanak and Mardana had not traveled very far from Sultanpur when the latter complained that he felt hungry and needed something to eat immediately.",

She took charge of both as the column moved out of Anandpur. While crossing on horseback the rivulet Sarsâ, then in spate, the three were separated from Gurû Gobind Siṅgh.\\nGaṅgû, who had also succeeded in crossing the stream, escorted them to his own house in the village of Kheṛî, now known as Saheṛî, near Moriṇḍâ in present-day Ropaṛ district. While unsaddling the horse he saw that there was some cash in the saddlebag. This tempted him to treachery. He not only stole the saddlebag during the night, but also planned to betray the fugitives to the government in hope of a reward. On the morning of 7 December 1705, the day of the fateful battle of Chamkaur, Zorâwar Siṅgh, along with Fateh Siṅgh and their grandmother, was taken into custody by Jânî Khân and Mânî Khân Raṅghaṛ, the officials at Moriṇḍâ.",

During the flight from Anandpur, when the Sikhs, having been promised safe passage to Punjab, Sahibzada Fateh Singh was, along with his elder brother Zorawar Singh, put under the care of his grandmother, Mata Gujari Kaur ji, Unfortunately in the confusion of the rain swollen Sarsa (normally little more than a creek) and an attack by Muslim pursuers, the Guru's two youngest sons and their Grandmother were separated from the main body of Sikhs. However, managing to get across they were befriended by one of the Guru's former cooks. Later betrayed and handed off by the authorities of the small village where they had been given sanctuary, they were handed over to agents of Wazir Khan and carted off to Sirhind and placed under arrest in the Khan's Thanda Burj (cold tower). While the Thanda Burj was built to capture the cool night breezes of air drawn over water channels in the areas hot summers, during the dead of winter the unheated burj offered no comfort for the Guru's mother and sons.On 26 December 1705, Fateh Singh and his elder brother, Zorawar Singh were martyred at Sirhind. Fateh Singh is probably the youngest recorded martyr in history who knowingly laid down his life at the very tender age of 6 years. Sahibzada Fateh Singh and his older brother, Sahibzada Zorawar Singh are among the most hallowed martyrs in Sikhism.\\nThe mind boggles to understand how children of such young age had the guts, courage, bravery and focus to refuse the promise of many lavish gifts and a future of cosy comforts of royalty that were being offered by the Mughals. All they had to do to get all these luxuries was to abandon their religion. This young child was asked to weigh an easy out against the stark option of a brutal, painful and tragic death entombed within a wall of bricks and cement.",

    "description": "Baba Deep Singh (26 January 1682 – 13 November 1757) is revered among Sikhs as one of the most hallowed martyrs in Sikhism. He is remembered for his sacrifice and devotion to the teachings of the Sikh Gurus. Baba Deep Singh was the first head of Misl Shaheedan Tarna Dal – an order of the Khalsa military established by Nawab Kapur Singh, the then head of Sharomani Panth Akali Buddha Dal. The Damdami Taksal also state that he was the first head of their order. Baba Deep Singh Ji was born on 26 January 1682 to his father Bhagta, and his mother Jioni. He lived in the village of Pahuwind in Amritsar district. He was born into a Sandhu Jat Sikh family. He went to Anandpur Sahib on the day of Vaisakhi in 1700, where he was baptised into Khalsa by Guru Gobind Singh Ji, through the Khande di Pahul or Amrit Sanchar (ceremonial initiation into Khalsa). As a youth, he spent considerable time in close companionship of Guru Gobind Singh Ji, learning weaponry, riding and other martial skills. From Bhai Mani Singh, he learnt reading and writing Gurmukhi and the interpretation of the Gurus' words. After spending two years at Anandpur, he returned to his village in 1702, before he was summoned by Guru Gobind Singh Ji at Talwandi Sabo in 1705, where he helped Bhai Mani Singh Ji in making copies of the ure Guru Granth Sahib. In 1709, Baba Deep Singh joined Banda Singh Bahadur during the Battle of Sadhaura and the Battle of Chappar Chiri. In 1733, Nawab Kapur Singh appointed him a leader of an armed squad (jatha). On the Vaisakhi of 1748, at the meeting of the Sarbat Khalsa in Amritsar, the 65 jathas of the Dal Khalsa were reorganized into twelve Misls. Baba Deep Singh was entrusted with the leadership of the Shaheed Misl. In April 1757, Ahmad Shah Durrani raided Northern India for the fourth time. While he was on his way back to Kabul from Delhi with young men and women as captives, the Sikhs made a plan to relieve him of the valuables and free the captives. The squad of Baba Deep Singh was deployed near Kurukshetra. His squad freed a large number of prisoners and raided Durrani's considerable treasury. On his arrival in Lahore, Durrani, embittered by his loss, ordered the demolition of the Harmandir Sahib (the \"Golden Gurudwara\"). The shrine was blown up and the sacred pool filled with the entrails of slaughtered animals. Durrani assigned the Punjab region to his son, Prince Timur Shah, and left him a force of ten thousand men under General Jahan Khan. Baba Deep Singh, 75 years old, felt that it was up to him to atone for the sin of having let the Afghans desecrate the shrine. He emerged from scholastic retirement and declared to a congregation at Damdama Sahib that he intended to rebuild the temple. Five hundred men came forward to go with him. Baba Deep Singh offered prayers before starting for Amritsar: \"May my head fall at the Darbar Sahib.\" As he went from hamlet to hamlet, many villagers joined him.",

The stone sculptures of the temple in the background, the open sky above, the art connoisseurs coming from India and abroad and the unforgettable presentation of the artists practicing Shiva's meditation on the stage set up in the middle. A similar scene occurs when it comes to Khajuraho Dance Festival. This joyous festival dedicated to the dignity and classicism of dance has entered its 50th year. Khajuraho Dance Festival was started in the year 1975 and since then it has been successfully organized continuously by the Ustad Alauddin Khan Music and Art Academy under the Culture Department of Madhya Pradesh Government. The form of art in India is like a traditional culture which flourishes through rigorous practice and not only expresses the artist's self but also describes the contemporary cultural scenario. In our culture, dance is not just a picturesque presentation but a meaningful effort that realizes the deep thoughts of the artist.\\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\\n                            The purpose of starting the Khajuraho dance festival was not only to preserve the classical dance but also to convey through classical dance the message which enables art lovers to experience the zenith of art through dance. From then till today this dance festival is being organized in the courtyard of the famous temples of Khajuraho. So far, young and senior artists of all the major classical dance styles of India like Bharatnatyam, Odissi, Kathak, Mohiniyattam, Kuchipudi, Kathakali, Yakshagana, Manipuri etc. have spread the aura of their art in the Khajuraho Dance Festival. Through the ceremony, an effort has been made to bring innovation while maintaining the dignity of classical dance. The festival is not limited to just dance presentation but also provides an opportunity to openly discuss and think about various aspects of dance and other arts. Other activities organized under the festival like Art Mart, Hunar, Nepathya, Kalavarta etc. also provide an opportunity to openly consider other aspects of art. For any art lover, the Khajuraho dance festival is such a spectacle that can answer every creative ebb and flow within him.",

    "description": "A ritual and a celebration that has no parallel anywhere in the world is the grand Mahamastakabhisheka that takes place in Shravanabelagola, Karnataka. It happens once in 12 years and is a grand spectacle that people wait for with bated breath.Mahamastakabhisheka is the abhisheka or anointment of the massive statue of Gomateshwara also known as Bahubali that stands atop the Vindhyagiri Hill in the town of Shravanabelagola of Hassan District, Karnataka. The last Mahamastakabhishekha, which was the 88th, took place in the year 2018, and the next one is to happen in the year 2030.There are many stories as to why the Mahamastakabhisheka happens every 12 years, however, the most plausible one suggests that this is because the Gomateshwara statue took 12 years to be completed.\\nAll roads seem to lead to Shravanabelagola during the Mahamastakabhisheka, about a million visitors propelled by faith and reverence swarm up the steep path that leads to the top of the Vindhyagiri hills, where stands the humongous statue of Bahubali that towers to a height of 57 feet. The monolithic statue is believed to be one of its kind in the world and dates back to the year 981 AD.The Mahasmatakabhishekha celebrations are a fitting tribute to the legendary Bahubali. It is a ritual that has been mounted on a magnificent and massive scale every 12 years since 981 AD. Massive scaffoldings are mounted on the mammoth statue of Gomateshwara in preparation for the anointment. The Mahamastakabhisheka celebrations are spread over a week and culminate with the grand Mahamastakabhisheka.\\n1008 Kalashas, pots of holy water, are placed at the feet of the Gomateshwara statue and then carried by devotees up the scaffolding. The water is then poured on the idol to the accompaniment of sacred chants. The statue is then anointed sequentially with coconut water, sugarcane juice, sandalwood paste, Vermilion and different types of flowers, gold, silver, and precious stones are also offered to Lord Bahubali by ardent devotees.\\nThe Mahamastakabhisheka is one of the important celebrations of Jains, it attracts people from across the globe. Some are drawn by faith, some by curiosity, and many flock to Shravanabelagola just to have a glimpse of the grand spectacle.\\nThe Mahamastakabhisheka in Shravanabelagola is indeed one of the grandest and most surreal spectacles on the planet. It makes for a once in a lifetime experience that leaves visitors with a bagful of memories to relive again and again.",

Kalasa is located very close to Hornadu which is famous for its ancient Annaporneshwari temple, believed to have been built by the revered sage Agasthya.\\n\\nKalasa has many sacred temples and water bodies that add to its serenity. There is a Shiva temple dating back to the 12th century in which Shiva is worshipped as Kalaseshwara. There is also a temple called Girijamba Temple in which Parvati is worshipped as Girijamba.\\n\\nKalasa is associated with the sacred marriage of Shiva and Parvati. According to legend, the celestial wedding of Shiva and Parvati took place in the Himalayas and was attended by all the celestial beings including Gods and Goddesses. The presence of so many divine beings upset the balance of the earth and it started tilting towards the north. To maintain the equilibrium of the earth, Lord Shiva requested Sage Agastya to move southwards. The sage expressed his desire to witness the divine wedding of Shiva and Parvati. Lord Shiva then granted him a divine vision, with which he would be able to see the wedding from wherever he was.\\n\\nSage Agastya then proceeded southwards and reached Kalasa, he stayed in Kalasa and watched the divine marriage of Lord Siva and Parvati from there.\\nThe marriage of Shiva and Parvati is celebrated to this day at the Girijamba Temple and Kalaseshwara temple annually, as Girija Kalyana and this celebration lasts for 10 days. The Rathotsava or Car festival of the Kalaseshwara temple is another major festival celebrated as Kalasa Jathre or fair that lasts for seven days. These festivals draw tourists in hordes from across Karnataka and other parts of India.",

    "description": "26th January 2020, is marked as 'Nirman Diwas' or  ‘Merger Day’ of two Union territories – ‘Dadra and Nagar Haveli’, and ‘Diu and Daman’. After the merger the new territory is  known with a simple new name ‘Dadra and Nagar Haveli, and Diu and Daman’ without compromising on their long known identities. The merger of the two UTs, located along the western coast near Gujarat, is exercised for better administration and to avoid duplication of various works.\\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\\n                            \\nThe history of achieving freedom and their establishment as union territories is really interesting. Both the union territories were under Portuguese rule for a long time and were liberated in December, 1961. From 1961 to 1987, Daman and Diu was part of the UT of Goa. When Goa attained statehood in the year 1987, Daman and Diu was made a separate Union Territory.\\nSince, June, 1783 Dadra and Nagar Haveli was  under the Portuguese rule. Finally, on August 2, 1954 residents of Dadra and Nagar Haveli liberated themselves from Portuguese rule. From, 1954 to 1961, the territory was administered by a citizen’s council called the Varishta Panchayat of Free Dadra and Nagar Haveli. Later, in the year 1961, Dadra and Nagar Haveli was merged with the Republic of India and made a Union Territory.\\nAfter, all these long years these two U.T.s are merged again on 26th January  in the year 2020 with new area around 603 km2 (233 sq mi). Both these territories are beautiful in their own way and perfect getaways to experience serenity away from the hustle bustle of the cities. A perfect amalgamation of modernity and nature makes these locations favorite amongst  travelers. The UT Administration each year celebrates the  Nirman Diwas by organising several activities and competitions. The  public buildings are lit up .",

It quickly became one of the most anticipated events on the city's calendar, and it has kept its allure even over a hundred years later. The themed flower exhibitions, formerly known as the summer and winter shows, have been marking important days and national holidays such as Republic and Independence Day since 1951.Lalbagh is a prominent botanical garden in Bangalore. This garden is home to a diverse range of plants and animals. Various different bird species may be found here, including the Myna, Common Egret, parakeets, and Pond Heron.

    "description": "India celebrates Republic Day on January 26 annually with a lot of pride and fervor. It is a day that is important to every Indian citizen. It marks the day when India became truly independent and embraced democracy. In other words, it celebrates the day on which our constitution came into effect. On 26 January 1950, almost 3 years post-independence, we became a sovereign, secular, socialist, democratic republic.It was therefore declared a National holiday and has been recognized and celebrated as the Republic Day of India ever since. It might seem like a question that curious pre-schoolers might ask but it is often asked why the date was specifically chosen for Republic Day to be celebrated. It is to be noted that January 26 had a great significance in India’s struggle for Swaraj or autonomy. The Congress Session at Lahore on December 29, 1929, had passed a resolution declaring Purna Swaraj or complete, absolute autonomy as India’s goal. It was also decided that the 26th of January should be observed all over India as Purna Swaraj Day. The complete Independence Day was celebrated on January 26th, 1930 for the first time. It continued to be observed until 1947. On achieving Independence, August 15 began to be celebrated as our Independence Day.",

The trios previously ruled the world of Carnatic music by producing hundreds of compositions while marking their imprints in history.

    "description": "A prominent Hindu ceremony entitled Arudhra Darisanam or Thiruvathirai Darisanam honours Lord Natraja, one of Shiva's well-known avatars. Every year during the Tamil month of Margazhi (in between December and January) this ceremony is celebrated with great zeal among the devotees. This festival is observed with tremendous fervour by the devotees of Tamil Nadu to honour the cosmic dance of Lord Shiva. The event honours Natraja, Lord Shiva's dancing manifestation, for his cosmic dance. According to the Vedas, Lord Shiva takes the form of Nataraja and performs the heavenly dance \"Thandavam\", while Arudhra symbolizes the bright-golden red flame blazing behind him.The Arulmigu Thillai Natarajar Temple is located in the Chidambaram town of the Cuddalore district. The temple was built in the tenth century, when Chidambaram functioned as the capital of the Chola dynasty. This temple is one of the “Pancha Bootha Sthalas”(Fire, Air, Water, Land, and Sky). Every year, the temple commemorates the occasion of Arudhra Darisanam with various festivities like special poojas, homams and car festival. On the occasion of this celebration, the presiding deity Lord Natarajar and his consort are adorned with silk robes and aromatic flower garlands. An “Abhisegham”(sacred bath) is performed on the deities along with special poojas. The presiding deity and his consort are carried in procession around the temple in an ornately decorated holy chariot as the faithful devotees chant hymns and devotional slogans alongside. Every year, lakhs of devotees flock to this event because Hindus believe that seeing the Arudhra Darisanam will bring serenity and contentment into their lives.",

    "description": "Hampi, the jewel of Karnataka and the pride of India is an enduring ode to the grandeur of India’s heritage. The stones and boulders of Hampi have a million stories to tell, a million symphonies to enthral you and transport you into the grand era of the Vijayanagara Empire. There is no better time to savour the nuances of Hampi and bask in its exquisite art in stone than during the Hampi Utsava.\\n\\nThe magnificent stone structures of Hampi erupt in a blaze of colour, dance, and music, every year during the much anticipated Hampi Utsava. The ruins of the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Hampi reverberate with the sounds of celebration as the Hampi Utsava also known as Vijaya Utsava takes centre stage.\\n\\nThe Vijayanagara Kings, including the most famous of them all, Emperor Krishnadevaraya who ruled over what was then the largest empire in India, the Vijayanagara Empire, were great patrons of music, dance, arts, architecture and literature.\\n\\nMusic and dance reached their zenith during the years of the Vijayanagara Empire and the many architectural marvels of Hampi are testimony to this. The intriguing musical pillars of Hampi’s Vijaya Vittala temple are just one example of the love of music being embedded in stone.\\n\\nThe Hampi Utsava is a colourful cultural extravaganza that simulates the ethos and grandeur of the glorious Vijayanagara Empire. Organised annually by the Government of Karnataka, the festival is celebrated over 2 to 3 days with much pomp and gaiety. The festival is reminiscent of the grand Vasantotsava that was celebrated during the time of the Vijayanagara Empire. The festival was then a 9-day affair and showcased dance, music, and literature.\\n\\nThe Hamp Utsava is an ode to the legacy of the Vijayanagara Empire. The ruins of Hampi standing silently by the side of the flowing waters of the Tungabhadra provides the perfect backdrop for the performances that ignite a billion sparks during the Hampi Utsava. The festival sees the main monuments that have stood the test of time being illuminated brilliantly in Hampi. Maestros of music, dance, and other performing arts mesmerise viewers with their magical performances. The Hampi Utsava is also a wonderful platform where the richness of the folk dances and folk music of Karnataka is showcased. A special segment of the festival is the Janapada Kalavahini which is an engaging medley of folk songs and folk dances.\\n\\nThe Hampi Utsava is a carnival of sorts for connoisseurs of culture. An elephant procession called, “Jambu Savari,” brings alive the vibes of the golden era of the Vijayanagara Empire. The festival also is a great opportunity to get acquainted with local handicrafts as well as revel in the flavours and aromas of the local cuisine of Karnataka.",

    "description": "One of the famous yatra or spiritual journey in the state of Maharashtra is the Pandharpur Wari, a Hindu pilgrimage walk conducted annually by a large group of devotees of Lord Vithoba, a Hindu deity worshipped predominantly by the people in Maharashtra . Wari or vari means a periodical pilgrimage to a sacred place and Warkari means one who performs the Wari. Visiting Pandharpur is a religious ceremony honouring the deity. These devotees walk for several days to Pandharpur, a town in Maharashtra known as the seat of the Hindu god. They carry Palkhis (palanquins) consisting Paduka (sandals) of Lord Vithoba’s famous saints Dnyaneshvar and Tukaram. According to some theories these two saints started the pilgrimage in 13th and 17th centuries respectively.\\n\\nThe spiritual walk commences from the shrines of the two saints Dnyaneshwar and Tukaram in Alandi and Dehu respectively, both of which are located in Pune, Maharashtra. Numerous other Palkhis join the wari on the way which has the main Palkhi and Paduka. There are two routes on which the Wari is performed. Dehu – Pandharpur and other Alandi – Pandharpur. The whole procession is divided into sub groups called as Dindi. There are more than 200 Dindis on each route. Each Dindi has between 100 and 500 members. The people participating in this procession wear holy basil beads and sing the glories of Vithoba with songs like “Gyanba Tukaram”.\\n\\nThe devotees carrying Palkhis complete the journey in 21 days culminating on the day of Ekadashi (eleventh lunar day) in the Hindu month of Ashadha (June-July). On the holy occasion of Ekadashi, the devotees reach Pandharpur and take a dip in the sacred Chandrabhaga river before proceeding for darshan at the Vithoba temple to celebrate their most revered deity.",

    "description": "History of Kanwar Yatra\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\\nThe  Kanwar Yatra is associated with the churning of the ocean of Amrit or Samudra Manthan in the month of Shravan as per the Hindu Puranas. Religious ures say that the churning of the ocean led to the emergence of poison or vish before the Amrit came out. This poison was consumed by Lord Shiva and the Amrit or Nectar of Immortality was distributed to the Gods. It was because of consuming the poison, Lord Shiva’s throat turned blue for which he was given the name “Neelkanth” and He felt a burning sensation in his throat. Gods and Devas poured Ganga Water to Lord Shiva to reduce the impact of the poison. Another story tells that it was Ravana, an ardent devotee of Lord Shiva, who brought Ganga water by using Kanwar and poured it on Shiva’s temple in Puramahadev. Since this happened in the month of Shravan, even today, Shiva’s devotees carry forward this tradition of pouring Holy Ganges water on the Shiv Linga every year in this month.\\nHighlights of Kanwar Yatra\\n\\n1) During the Kanwar Yatra, the devotees of Lord Shiva carry the 'Kanwar' on both of their shoulders.\\n2) The Yatra happens from mid-July to August. Thus, it is almost a month pilgrim journey in which the devotees wear saffron-coloured. clothes and walk barefoot from the chosen destination to collect the holy water of Ganges in Haridwar, Gangotri or Gaumukh.\\n3) Numbers of makeshift accommodations are constructed across the journey where the Kanwarias can take a rest for a while.\\n4) Some devotees travel the distance on foot while others on their personal vehicles.\\n5) Throughout the journey, the Kanwarias chant the slogan of 'Bol Bam' along with the religious bhajans of Lord Shiva.\\n6) Several NGOs offer free services like food, water, tea, or medical help to Kanwarias.",

    "description": "Kerala is well-known for its water bodies that take the form of canals, backwaters and rivers. And there are regions in Kerala, where water dominates life of those living in its vicinity. The southern district of Alappuzha is one such region in Kerala that takes the credit of having a great amount of area under water. Some of the rivers rising in the highlands of the Western Ghats, flow down to join the vast stretches of backwaters and canals that crisscross the heart of Alappuzha and the nearby region of Kottayam.\\n\\nThe backwaters of Alappuzha support a rich wealth of fish and are also home to several species of life forms, both inside and outside the water. Birds, both local as well as migratory ones, find these water bodies ideal for feeding, nesting and breeding. The local people look forward to these water bodies for food in the form of a variety of fish and also for livelihood.\\n\\nTalking about boat races and Alappuzha, we are getting close to the riveting annual boat race and one of the popular races in and around Alappuzha - the annual Champakulam boat race.\\n\\nIt is the oldest Snake Boat Race in the State and kicks off the boat race season annually. The Pampa River plays host to this race held in Champakkulam, a village in Alappuzha district. Held normally in June or July, the crowds it draws are enormous. Massive boats splitting the waters apart as ancient boat songs are hummed make for an exhilarating experience. This is the event that kicks off the boat racing frenzy which takes over the State for the next few months.",

    "description": "It is a four-day temple festival, celebrated in the Tamil month of Adi since 1929, culminates in mango-strewn streets in Karaikal. People gather from district to district to attend and witness this unique celebration of Saint Karaikal Ammaiyar. Due to the global pandemic Covid-19, the 91-year-old tradition has to take a break.  \\n\\n The Mangani festival at Karaikal's, the oldest Hindu temple, an enclave of Puducherry, is surrounded by an interesting legend. It is the temple of Lord Somanathar and his spouse Somanayaki. It is adjacent to the shrine and wedding dais of Punithavathi, who later became Saint Karaikal Ammaiyar. The name of her temple makes her one of the few saints of the 5th century to have one.\\n\\n The story behind the great poet Seikhizar in his monumental work \"Periyapuranam\", a portrait in the gallery of 63 canonised Saivite saints tells the story of these saints in 66 quatrains, begins with the story of Punithavathi, a devout woman married to Paramadattan. One day, Paramadattan sent two mangoes to his wife through a worker from his working place and asked her to keep them for lunch. An hour later, a devotee of Lord Shiva came yasagam for some food, as the food wasn't ready, Punithavathi had to offer him a mango.\\n\\nWhen her Paramadattan returned, Punithavathi served him the other ripped mango. It was so delicious that he asked for another one too. Punithavathi starts to pray, and suddenly a ripe mango fell into her palm. Finding the fruit tasty and juicy, he asked her where she got it from. When she confessed her prayers, Paramadattan looked unconvinced and asked her to procure another such fruit. She prayed again and received one more fruit, but it got vanished when her husband tried to touch it. Paramadattan realised that it was an act of intervention. He got scared and left her. \\n\\n Later, when some relatives of Punithavathi discovered the injustice done by her husband, they confronted him. In his explanation, Paramadattan asked Punithavathi's relatives to worship her. But Punithavathi could not find her peace. She began to pray for a fleshless skeletal body & a way to serve Lord Shiva. Her request was heard, and since then, people began offering her respect, and she became Karaikal Ammaiyar.\\n\\n This festival marks the salvation attained by Punithavathi through the medium of a ripe mango. On this day, Lord Shiva's idol is dressed as a mendicant and taken out in a ritual. On this day, the natives of Karaikal welcome their guests on a delicious dinner with vadai and payasam. They honour the idol with a garland of vetti veir, two ripped mangoes, betel leaves and nuts, and a silken cloth. Punithavathi's abandonment of her beauty after her husband worshipped her divinity and her ensuing transformation into an emaciated form is commemorated remarkable. This festival is marked by dance, music, drama and public speeches to a finale along with the fireworks displays in the end.",

Known for its splendid architecture, temples and as a base for numerous excursions, Chamba holds many fairs and festivals; Minjar being the biggest celebration. Minjar fair has been declared as one of the State fairs of Himachal Pradesh.\\n\\nThis fair is held on the second Sunday of the Shravana month. The fair is announced by distribution of Minjar which is a silk tassel worn on some parts of the dress by men and women alike. This tassel symbolises the shoots of paddy and maize which make their appearance around this time of the year.\\n\\nThe week long fair begins when the Minjar flag is hoisted in historical Chowgan. The town of Chamba wears a colourful look with every person touring out in best attire. Sports and cultural programmes are organised. A procession of Lord Raghuvir, the local deity, culminates with immersing of fruits and Minjar in the river. In the evenings, cultural performances and entertainment programs are held. For tourists it is a time to witness the rich culture, savour traditional dishes and buy souvenirs like the famous embroidered Chamba rumal, hand woven woollen shawls and the Chamba Chappal.\\n\\nOn the third Sunday the gaiety, colorfulness and enthusiasm reaches its crescendo when the colorful Minjar procession of the deities accompanied by dancing troupes, traditionally attired locals, traditional drum beaters along with Police and Home Guards band, begins its march from Akhand Chandi Palace for the venue near the Police lines Nalhora. A great concourse  of people is already assembled there. Earlier the Raja and now the chief guest throws a coconut, a rupee, a seasonal fruit and a Minjar tied in a red piece of cloth – Lohan - as offering to the river. This is followed by all the people throwing their Minjars into the river. Traditional Kumjari-Malhar is sung by the local artists. Betal leaves and ittra are offered to everyone among the invitees as a gesture of respect and festivity.\\n\\nMinjar is the most popular fair of Chamba which is attended by a large number of people from all over the country. Undoubtedly Chamba is at its very best during this fair that generally falls in the month of July/ August.

    "description": "Venue : All Over Kerala. \\n\\nKarkida, the last month of Malayalam calendar which falls in July- August has some religious significance for Hindus. Karkidaka Vavu Bali, also called Bali, is the sacrificial ritual performed in memory of the departed souls of ancestors. On the day of vavu or Amavasi (no moon day) people belonging to the Hindu religion gather on the riverbanks and beaches to offer bali. Varkala Papanasam beach is also one of the major religious destinations on the day. People believe that the departed souls attain `moksha(liberartion) if the ritualistic homage is performed on Karkidaka vavu.\\n\\nThousands of people throng the beach on that day offering ritual poojas with darbha (a type of grass), pavithram – the ring made of sacred grass, sesame, and herbs like cheroola. Other ingredients of the pooja – cooked rice, water, etc. will also be placed on a banana leaf before commencing the ritual. Priests from the ancient Janardhana temple help people perform the ritual.\\n\\nMen, women and children offer Bali to the ancestors. Men wear only a dhoti during the ritual and the offerings done on the banana leaf will be finally immersed in the waters of the sea.",

    "description": "Tsungremmong is a pre-harvest festival celebrated by the Ao Nagas. On the eve of harvest during the time of the forefathers, this festival was held for six days, marking the end of rigorous plantation besides nursing the paddy fields followed by sacrificial offerings. During the festival, tribals wear traditional garbs, sing traditional songs and perform their ritualistic dances to express their gratitude to God for giving a high yield. During the festival, wearing their colorful customs both the young and the old sing songs and perform dances to express their appreciation to the supreme power for helping the crops to grow well, while they also give the best offerings for abundant blessings. This gives an opportunity to the youngsters to reveal their intellectual skills and physical ability. A handful of young men hold the stage and tell amusing stories about the elders while greeting them by jumping in enthusiasm. The festival is usually rounded off by a tug-of-war between men and women.",

During Muharram, the islands come alive in vibrant faith and devotion.\\n\\nMuharram is a sacred festival that commemorates the martyrdom of Hazrat Imam Hussein in Karbala. The holy month of Muharram is a period marked by faith, devotion, and grief. Historically Islam arrived in the Lakshadweep Islands during the 7th century. A shipwreck brought a Muslim saint named Ubaidullah to Lakshadweep, and slowly Islam took root in the Lakshadweep Islands.\\n\\nThe Muharram festival is actually an occasion for remorse and grief, and it is observed with great zeal and enthusiasm by the people of Lakshadweep. One of the highlights of the Muharram festival is the colourful Tazia processions that criss-cross across the beautiful islands of Lakshadweep. While the Tazias symbolize martyrdom, people dressed in black who are part of the processions symbolize grief and mourning. The processions are marked by people indulging in self-flagellation as a mark of grief and mourning.",

It is held every year on the second Saturday of August at the Punnamada Lake near Alappuzha in Kerala.\\n\\nThis boat race is named after the first prime minister of India, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru and there is an interesting story behind it. When Nehru visited Kerala in 1952, he was enthralled by the beautiful sight of the snake boats and the rhythmic movement of oars that accompanied each of them. It is believed that he could not control his excitement and jumped into one of the boats himself without caring for his own security.\\n\\nEventually, the boat race came to be named after Pandit Nehru to honour his love for snake boats. Every year, the winner of the race is presented with a trophy known as the Nehru Trophy.\\n\\nDuring the boat race festival, Lake Punnamada and the region surrounding it come to life. Beautiful snake boats, colourful water floats and pretty country rafts adorn the lake. Every year, more than 2 lakh visitors from India and abroad come here to be part of the festivities.\\n\\nVarious kinds of boats compete in different categories. However, the most popular ones are the Kerala snake boats, locally known as Chundan Vallam, which have 100 rowers sitting on both sides and paddling away in unity. The sight is truly a spectacle to behold.",

She was supposedly discovered as an orphan by the local leader of Lada. According to legend, Bhadu represents the goddess Lakshmi in physical form. She is adopted by the chief, who covertly rears her as a princess. Bhadu develops feelings for Anjan, a doctor's son from a nearby village. The king has Anjan imprisoned because he disapproves of the union. Bhadu and his two companions then journey through the kingdom while singing at the fort and castle gates, hoping that Anjan will hear her voice. The king eventually releases Anjan, but by then Bhadu has disappeared, and is said to have faded away and merged with the sky.\\nThe tale of a princess from Panchakote named Bhadravati (Bhadresvari) who vanished mysteriously is where it all began. Throughout the month, Bhadravati's followers create a picture of her and perform songs and dances in front of it. On the final day of Bhadra, they assemble along the river and submerge the picture. The festival's main draw is its songs, which primarily centre on marriage. Both professional ensembles and amateur performers participate. Cultural events and fairs are a part of celebrations.",

    "description": "Lord Krishna’s grew up in Vrindavan to be a cowherd boy, who loved dairy so much, he’d steal into other people’s homes for it. The villagers would keep their pots of curd and cream tied high up the ceiling, so Krishna wouldn’t reach it. But he found a way around it too! He would gather some of his other shepherd friends and together they’d form a human pyramid to allow Krishna to clamber up and break open the earthen pots so that they may all eat.\\n\\nEach year, some regions across India , especially Maharashtra recreate this part of Lord Krishna’s life to commemorate Krishna Janamasthami (Birth day of Lord Krishna) . This celebration is very pompous and warrants a visit to Mumbai, where youngsters practice for days to be able to crack the dahi handi. An earthen pot filled with yogurt is tied high up. All the boys in the neighbourhood make a human pyramid, not unlike the one Lord Krishna is said to have made, and gather under the handi (earthen pot). They then maintain balance, as one of them climbs up and breaks the pot. To make this task a tad harder, the non-participants and the womenfolk throw water at the participants. Such is the craze for this event in Maharashtra that there are cash prizes announced for the winners of a successful dahi handi, these prizes go upto INR 1 lac even! Ala Re Ala, Govinda Ala (Lord Krishna has come!) is a Marathi cheer rendition to help the boys climb up and break the handi.\\n\\nDahi Handi on Janmashtami isn’t a mere ritual or a celebration it is an emotion for many across the country. But the Dahi Handi holds special importance in Mumbai – definitely not to be missed!\\n\\nWith time the whole event has its own slogan Govinda Aala Re!",

    "description": "Manimahesh Yatra\\n\\nThe Himalayas is believed to be the abode of Lord Shiva and several peaks bearing the name Kailash across the great mountain chain are held sacred as the place where the Lord resides. The towering Manimahesh Kailash peak at 5656 meters in Bharmaur mountains of Chamba is one of them.\\n\\nAt the foot of the peak is a turquoise lake whose waters are said to have healing properties. After the summer snowmelt opens up a trekking path to the lake, in August-September thousands of pilgrims undertake a pilgrimage to Manimahesh Lake (4190 meters) to pay obeisance and to celebrate being in the divine environment.\\n\\nA Chhari Yatra starts from Chamba with pilgrims carrying sacred symbols of Lord Shiva and after passing by Bharmaur, slowly wind up their way up on an arduous route to bathe in the icy waters of the lake and worship by a small lakeside temple.\\n\\nManimahesh means Lord Shiva’s jewel. On the day of the ritual bathing, under a clear sky, mesmerized believers at dawn witness a dazzling spectacle when the sun rays hit the peak. The large mountain is suddenly illuminated and it appears to be one large diamond. This rare sight has given birth to several myths and also its name ‘Mani’. Spending a night near the lake, it is in the early morning hours of the 15th day of Janamashtmi that pilgrims seek to take a dip in the holy lake. To uphold the mountains sacredness no one attempts to scale it.\\n\\nFrom Chamba, Bharmaur is 65 Km and can be reached by bus or a taxi. Motorable transport is possible up to Hadsar, which is 13 Km from Bharmaur. From here on, the remaining journey has to be done on foot with temporary shelters put up along the way for night stays. Dhanchoo, 11 Km from Hadsar, is a day’s trek and to get to the lake you have to climb past Bandar Ghati, Gauri Kund, Shiv Kalotri and Ganesh Ghati.\\n\\nAt Bharmaur, Himachal Tourism runs Hotel Gaurikund - a budget hotel that provides decent accommodation. There are also many private hotels and home stays in and around Bharmaur providing basic accommodation.\\n\\nThe Manimahesh Lake is situated about 35 kilometers from Bharmour in the Budhil Valley. Every year, on the eighth day of the light half of the moon in the month of Bhadon, a fair is held at this lake, which attracts thousands of pilgrims who assemble here to take a dip in the holy water. Lord Shiva is the presiding deity of this Fair/Jatra. He is believed to reside in Kailash. A rock formation in the shape of a Shivling on Kailash is considered to be the manifestation of Lord Shiva. The snowfield at the base of the mountain is called Shiva's Chaugan by the local people.",
